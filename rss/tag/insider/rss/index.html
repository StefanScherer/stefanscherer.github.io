Here's my approach to run a Windows Docker engine with the latest Insider build.</p>
<h2 id="buildtheazurevm">Build the Azure VM</h2>
<p>On your local machine clone the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows">packer-windows</a> repo which has a Terraform template to build an Azure VM. The template chooses a V3 machine which is able to run nested VM's.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2018/01/insider_in_azure_terraform_apply.png" alt="Create a VM in Azure with Terraform"></p>
<p>You need <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a> on your local machine which can be installed with a package manager.</p>
<p>Mac:</p>
<pre><code>brew install terraform
</code></pre>
<p>Windows:</p>
<pre><code>choco install terraform
</code></pre>
<p>Now clone the GitHub repo and go to the template.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows
cd packer-windows/nested/terraform
</code></pre>
<p>Adjust the <code>variables.tf</code> file with resource group name, account name and password, region and other things. You also need some information for Terraform to create resources in your Azure account. Please read the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/">Azure Provider</a> documentation for details how to obtain these values.</p>
<pre><code>export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=&quot;uuid&quot;
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=&quot;uuid&quot;
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=&quot;uuid&quot;
export ARM_TENANT_ID=&quot;uuid&quot;

terraform apply
</code></pre>
<p>This command will take some minutes until the VM is up and running. It also runs a provision script to install further tools for you.</p>
<h2 id="rdpintothepackerbuildervm">RDP into the Packer builder VM</h2>
<p>Now log into the Azure VM with a RDP client. This VM has Hyper-V installed as well as Packer and Vagrant, the tools we will use next.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2018/01/insider_in_azure_packer_build_vagrant_up.png" alt="Run Packer and Vagrant in Azure VM"></p>
<h2 id="buildtheinsidervm">Build the Insider VM</h2>
<p>The next step is to build the Windows Insider Server VM. We will use <a href="https://packer.io">Packer</a> for the task. This produces a Vagrant box file that can be re-used locally on a Windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>Clone the packer-windows repo and run the Packer build with the manually downloaded Insider ISO file.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows
cd packer-windows

packer build --only=hyperv-iso --var iso_url=~/Downloads/Windows_InsiderPreview_Server_2_17074.iso windows_server_insider_docker.json
</code></pre>
<p>This command will take some minutes as it also downloads the Insider Docker images to have them cached when you start a new VM.</p>
<p>Add the box file so it can be used by Vagrant.</p>
<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_server_insider_docker windows_server_insider_docker_hyperv.box
</code></pre>
<h2 id="boottheinsidervm">Boot the Insider VM</h2>
<p>Now we're using <a href="https://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to boot the Insider VM. I'll use my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/windows-docker-machine">windows-docker-machine</a> Vagrant template which I also use locally on a Mac or Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/windows-docker-machine
cd windows-docker-machine
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload

vagrant up --provider hyperv insider
</code></pre>
<p>This will spin up a VM and creates TLS certificates for the Docker engine running in the Windows Insider Server VM.</p>
<p>You could use it from the Azure VM, but we want to make the nested VM reachable from our laptop.</p>
<p>Now retrieve the IP address of this nested VM to add some port mappings so we can access the nested VM from our local machine.</p>
<pre><code>vagrant ssh-config
</code></pre>
<p>Use the IP address shown for the next commands, eg. 192.168.0.10</p>
<pre><code>netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=2376 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=2376 connectaddress=192.168.0.10
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=9000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=9000 connectaddress=192.168.0.10
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3390 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3389 connectaddress=192.168.0.10
</code></pre>
<h2 id="createdockertlsforexternaluse">Create Docker TLS for external use</h2>
<p>As we want to access this Docker engine from our local laptop we have to re-create the TLS certs with the FQDN of the Azure VM.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2018/01/insider_in_azure_rdp.png" alt="RDP to Azure and nested VM"></p>
<p>Now RDP into the nested VM through port 3390 from your laptop.</p>
<p>You will see a CMD terminal. Run <code>powershell</code> to enter a PowerShell terminal.</p>
<p>Run the <code>create-machine.ps1</code> provision script again with the IP address and the FQDN of the Azure VM. Also specify the path of your local home directory (in my case <code>-machineHome /Users/stefan</code>) to make the docker-machine configuration work.</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\demo\insider-docker-machine\scripts\create-machine.ps1 -machineHome /Users/stefan -machineName az-insider -machineIp 1.2.3.4 -machineFqdn az-insider-01.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
</code></pre>
<h2 id="rundockercontainers">Run Docker containers</h2>
<p>You can copy the generated TLS certificates from the nested VM through the RDP session back to your home directory in <code>$HOME/.docker/machine/machines</code> folder.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2018/01/insider_in_azure-1.png" alt="insider_in_azure-1"></p>
<p>Then you can easily switch the Docker environment variables locally on your</p>
<p>Mac:</p>
<pre><code>eval $(docker-machine env az-insider)
</code></pre>
<p>or Windows:</p>
<pre><code>docker-machine env az-insider | iex
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should be able to run Docker commands like</p>
<pre><code>docker images
docker run -it microsoft/nanoserver-insider cmd
</code></pre>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have used a lot of tools to create this setup. If you do this only once it seems to be more step than needed. But keep in mind the Insider builds are shipped regularly so you will do some steps again and again.</p>
<p>To repeat some of these steps tools like Packer and Vagrant can help you go faster building VM's as Docker helps you go faster to ship your apps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Packer helps you repeat building a VM from new ISO.</li>
<li>Vagrant helps you repeat booting fresh VMs. Destroy early and often. Rebuild is cheap.</li>
<li>Docker helps you repeat creating and running applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have another approach to run Insider builds in Azure please let me know. I love to hear your story. Please use the comments below if you have questions or want to share your setup.</p>

They promise us much smaller sizes to have more lightweight Windows images for our applications.</p>
<p>To use these Insider container images you also need an Insider preview of Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10. Yes, this is another great announcement that you can get early access and give feedback to the upcoming version of Windows Server. So let's grab it.</p>
<h2 id="windowsserverinsider">Windows Server Insider</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Register at Windows Insider program <a href="https://insider.windows.com">https://insider.windows.com</a> and join the Windows Server Insider program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the Windows Server Insider preview ISO from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewserver">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewserver</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can create a VM and install Docker. You can either build the VM manually and follow the docs <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/using-insider-container-images">&quot;Using Insider Container Images&quot;</a> how to install Docker and pull the Insider container images. Or you can use my Packer template and Vagrant environment to automate these steps. The walkthrough is described at</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/insider-docker-machine">https://github.com/StefanScherer/insider-docker-machine</a></p>
<h2 id="windowsinsiderimages">Windows Insider images</h2>
<p>There are four new Docker images available with a much smaller footprint.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/windows_insider_images.png" alt="Windows Insider images"></p>
<ul>
<li>microsoft/windowsservercore-insider</li>
<li>microsoft/nanoserver-insider</li>
<li>microsoft/nanoserver-insider-dotnet</li>
<li>microsoft/nanoserver-insider-powershell</li>
</ul>
<p>The Windows Server Core Insider image got down from 5 GB to only 2 GB which saves a lot of bandwidth and download time.</p>
<p>You may wonder why there are three Nano Server Insider images and why there is one without PowerShell.</p>
<h2 id="aimingthesmallestwindowsbaseimage">Aiming the smallest Windows base image</h2>
<p>If we compare the image sizes of the current <code>microsoft/nanoserver</code> image with its base layer and update layer with the new Insider images you can see the reason.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/nanoserver_sizes.png" alt="NanoServer sizes"></p>
<p>If you want to ship your application in a container image you don't want to ship a whole operating system, but only the parts needed to run the application.</p>
<p>And to ship faster is to ship smaller images. For many applications you do not need eg. PowerShell inside your base image at runtime which would take another 54 MByte to download from the Docker registry.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at current Windows Docker images available on the Docker Hub. To run a Golang webserver for example on an empty Windows Docker host you have to pull the 2MB binary and the two NanoServer base layers with hundreds of MB to run it in a container.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/docker-pull-whoami.png" alt="docker pull whoami"></p>
<p>Of course these base images have to be downloaded only once as other NanoServer container images will use the same base image. But if you work with Windows containers for a longer time you may have noticed that you still have to download different update layers from time to time that pull another 122 MB.</p>
<p>And if the NanoServer base image is much smaller then the updates also will be smaller and faster to download.</p>
<p>With the new Insider container images you can build and run containerized .NET core applications that are still smaller than the NanoServer + PowerShell base image.</p>
<h2 id="nodejs">Node.js</h2>
<p>Another example is providing a Node.js container image based on the new NanoServer Insider image with only 92 MByte. We have just cut off &quot;3&quot; hundred MB.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/nodejs_nanoserver_sizes-3.png" alt="Node.js NanoServer sizes"></p>
<p>If we compare that with some of the Linux Node.js container images we are at about the size of the the slim images.</p>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/Bildschirmfoto-2017-07-14-um-08.53.24.png" alt="Node.js slim image sizes"></p>
<h2 id="multistagebuild">Multi-stage build</h2>
<p>To build such small Windows images comes with a cost. You have to live without PowerShell. But the new multi-stage build introduced with Docker 17.05 really helps you and you can use PowerShell before the final image layers are built.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard about multi-stage builds its concept is to have multiple <code>FROM</code> instructions in a <code>Dockerfile</code>. Only the last <code>FROM</code> until the end of the file will build the final container image. This is also called the last stage. In all the other stages you don't have to optimze too much and can use the build cache much better. You can read more about <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2017/07/multi-stage-builds/">multi-stage builds</a> at the Docker Blog.</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look how to build a small Node.js base image. You can find the complete <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/07cedcf2cc93e669bba9c961121feda6f43dab59/node/8.1/nano/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>In the first stage I'm lazy and even use the <code>microsoft/windowsservercore-insider</code> image. The reason is that I'm using the GPG tools to verify the downloads and these tools don't run quiet well in NanoServer at the moment.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile"># escape=`
FROM microsoft/windowsservercore-insider as download
SHELL [&quot;powershell&quot;, &quot;-Command&quot;, &quot;$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'; $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue';&quot;]
RUN Invoke-WebRequest ... 
RUN Expand-Archive ...
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> has a second <code>FROM</code> instruction which then uses the smallest Windows base image. In that stage you normally <code>COPY</code> deploy files and folders from previous stages. In our case we copy the Node.js installation folder into the final image.</p>
<p>The one <code>RUN</code> instruction sets the <code>PATH</code> environment variable with the <code>setx</code> command instead of PowerShell commands.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM microsoft/nanoserver-insider
ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL info
COPY --from=download /nodejs /nodejs
RUN setx PATH &quot;%PATH%;C:\nodejs;%APPDATA%\npm&quot;
CMD [ &quot;node.exe&quot; ]
</code></pre>
<p>Users of such a Node.js base image can work as usual by <code>COPY</code> deploy their source tree and node_modules folder into that image and run the application as a small container.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM stefanscherer/node-windows:8.1.4-insider
WORKDIR /code
COPY . /code
CMD [&quot;node.exe&quot;, &quot;app.js&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>So all you have to do is change the <code>FROM</code> instruction to the smaller insider Node.js image.</p>
<h2 id="furtherinsiderimages">Further Insider images</h2>
<p>I have pushed some of my first Insider images to the Docker Hub so it may be easier for you to try out different languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>stefanscherer/node-windows:6.11.1-insider</li>
<li>stefanscherer/node-windows:8.1.4-insider</li>
<li>stefanscherer/golang-windows:1.8.3-insider</li>
<li>stefanscherer/dockertls-windows:insider</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see how these images are built, then you can find the <code>Dockerfiles</code> in the latest pull requests of my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows</a> repo.</p>
<h2 id="dockervolumes">Docker Volumes</h2>
<p>If you have worked with Docker Volumes on Windows you may know this already. Node.js and other tools and languages have problems when they want to get the real name of a file or folder that is mapping from the Docker host into the container.</p>
<p>Node.js for example thinks the file is in the folder <code>C:\ContainerMappedDirectories</code>, but cannot find the file there. There is a workaround described in Elton Stoneman's blog post <a href="https://blog.sixeyed.com/docker-volumes-on-windows-the-case-of-the-g-drive/">&quot;Introducing the 'G' Drive&quot;</a> to map it to another drive letter.</p>
<p>With the new Insider preview I see a great improvement on that topic. Running normal Windows containers without the HyperV isolation there is no longer a symbolic link.</p>
<p>If we run the Node.js container interactively and map the folder <code>C:\code</code> into the container we can list the <code>C:</code>drive and see that the <code>code</code> folder is a normal directory.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -v C:\code:C:\code stefanscherer/node-windows:8.1.4-insider cmd /c dir
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/docker-run-nodejs.png-shadow.png" alt="docker run volume"></p>
<p>With this setup you are able to mount your source code into the Node.js container and run it eg. with <code>nodemon</code> to live reload it after changing it on the host.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not available with the Hyper-V isolation that is the default on Windows 10 Insider machines.</p>
<p>Running the same command with <code>--isolation=hyperv</code> shows the symlinked directory which Node.js cannot handle at the moment.</p>
<pre><code>docker run -v C:\code:C:\code --isolation=hyperv stefanscherer/node-windows:8.1.4-insider cmd /c dir
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/07/docker-run-nodejs-hyperv.png-shadow.png" alt="docker run volume hyperv"></p>
<p>But this improvement in native Windows containers looks very promising to solve a lot of headache for all the maintainers of Git for Windows, Golang, Node.js and so on.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Having smaller Windows container images is a huge step forward. I encourage you to try out the much smaller images. You'll learn how it feels to work with them and you can give valuable feedback to the Microsoft Containers team shaping the next version of Windows Server.</p>
<p>Can we make even smaller images? I don't know, but let's find it out. How about naming the new images? Please make suggestions at the Microsoft Tech Community <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com</a>.</p>
