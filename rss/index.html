With this you can work with Docker running <strong>Linux containers</strong> in a very easy way on Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V installed. In the meantime there is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">stable version and a beta channel</a> to retrieve newer versions.</p>

<p>And Microsoft has added the <strong>Containers feature</strong> in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. With some <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start_windows_10">installation steps</a> you are able to run <strong>Windows Hyper-V Containers</strong> on your Windows 10 machine.</p>

<p>But there is a little bit of confusion which sort of containers can be started with each of the two installations. And you can't run both Docker Engines side-by-side without some adjustments.</p>

<p>This is because each of the installations use the same default named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine</code> causing one of the engines to fail to start.</p>

<h2 id="beta26torulethemall">Beta 26 to rule them all</h2>

<p>Beginning with the Docker for Windows Beta 26 there is a very easy approach to solve this confusion. You only have to install Docker for Windows with the MSI installer. There is a new menu item in the Docker tray icon to switch between Linux and Windows containers.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-for-windows-switch.gif" alt="switching"></p>

<p>As you can see in the video you don't have to change environment variables or use the <code>-H</code> option of the Docker client to talk to the other Docker engine.</p>

<p>So if you download <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">Docker for Windows beta</a> or switch to the beta channel in your installation you can try this out yourself.</p>

<p>The installer will activate the <strong>Containers</strong> feature if you haven't done that yet. A reboot is required for this to add this feature.</p>

<p>From now on you can easily switch with the menu item in the tray icon.</p>

<p>There also is a command line tool to switch the engine. In a PowerShell windows you can type</p>

<pre><code>&amp; 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
</code></pre>

<p>and it switches from Linux to Windows or vice versa. Take care and type the option as shown here as the option is case sensitive.</p>

<h2 id="proxyfortherescue">Proxy for the rescue</h2>

<p>But how does the switching work without the need to use another named pipe or socket from the Docker client?</p>

<p>The answer is that there is running a Proxy process <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> which listens on the default named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine</code>.</p>

<p>If you switch from Linux to Windows the Windows Docker engine <code>dockerd.exe</code> will be started for you which is listening on another named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine_windows</code> and a new started Proxy process redirects to this.</p>

<h3 id="underthehood">Under the hood</h3>

<p>I have installed the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/bb896645">Sysinternals Process Monitor</a> tool to learn what happens while switching from Linux to Windows containers. With the Process Tree function you can see a timeline with green bars when each process has started or exited.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows the processes before and after the switch. I have switched about in the middle of the green bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/switch-to-windows-dockerd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The current <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> (above <code>dockerd.exe</code> in the list) that talked to the MobyLinuxVM exits as the dark green bar highlights that.</p>

<p>The <code>dockerd.exe</code> Windows Docker engine is started, as well as a new <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> (below <code>dockerd.exe</code>) which talks to the Windows Docker engine.</p>

<p>So just after the switch you still can use the <code>docker.exe</code> Client or your Docker integration in your favorite editor or IDE without any environment changes.</p>

<h2 id="runningbothcontainerworldsinparallel">Running both container worlds in parallel</h2>

<p>The proxy process just switches the connection to the Docker engine. After such a switch both the Linux and Windows Docker engine are running.</p>

<h3 id="runalinuxwebserver">Run a Linux web server</h3>

<p>To try this out we first switch back to the Linux containers. Now we run the default nginx web server on port 80</p>

<pre><code>docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx  
</code></pre>

<p>then switch to the Windows containers with</p>

<pre><code>&amp; 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-run-nginx.png" alt="docker-run-nginx"></p>

<p>Now let's run some Windows containers. But first we try if the Linux container is still running and reachable with</p>

<pre><code>start http://localhost  
</code></pre>

<p>With the <code>start</code> command you open Edge with the welcome page of the nginx running in a Linux container</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/nginx.png" alt="nginx"></p>

<p>Yes, the Linux container is still running.</p>

<h2 id="buildawindowswebserver">Build a Windows web server</h2>

<p>On Windows 10 you <del>only can run Nanoserver containers. There is no IIS docker image for Nanoserver</del>. <strong>Ignite update</strong>: You can run Nanoserver <strong>AND</strong> windowsservercore containers on Windows 10.</p>

<p>But to demo how simple nanoserver containers could be I'll keep the following sample as it is. So we create our own small Node.js web server. First we write the simple web server app</p>

<pre><code>notepad app.js  
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this code as the mini web server in the file <code>app.js</code> and save the file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var http = require('http');  
var port = 81;

function handleRequest(req, res) {  
  res.end('Hello from Windows container, path = ' + req.url);
}

var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);

server.listen(port);  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we build a Windows Docker image with that application. We open another editor to create the <code>Dockerfile</code> with this command</p>

<pre><code>notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this as the <code>Dockerfile</code>. As you can see only the <code>FROM</code> line is different from a typical Linux Dockerfile. This one uses a Windows base image from the Docker Hub.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM stefanscherer/node-windows:6.7.0-nano

COPY app.js app.js

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file and build the Docker image with the usual command</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t webserver .  
</code></pre>

<p>Run the Windows web server as a Docker container with</p>

<pre><code>docker run -p 81:81 -d webserver  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-run-webserver-1.png" alt="docker-run-webserver"></p>

<p>At the moment you can't connect directly with 127.0.0.1 to the container. But it is possible to use the IP address of the container. We need the ID or name of the container, so list the containers running with</p>

<pre><code>docker ps  
</code></pre>

<p>Then open the browser with the container's IP address:  </p>

<pre><code>start http://$(docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" grave_thompson):81  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-inspect.png" alt="docker-inspect"></p>

<p>Additionally the port forwarding from the host to the container allows you to contact the web server on port 81 from another machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/curl-to-windows-10.png" alt="curl-to-windows-10"></p>

<p>And yes, the Windows container is also handling requests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The new Docker for Windows beta combines the two container worlds and simplifies building Docker images for both Linux and Windows, making a Windows 10 machine a good development platform for both.</p>

<p>And with a little awareness when to switch to the right Docker engine, both Linux and Windows containers can run side-by-side.</p>

Beside lots of new features in Docker 1.12 we heard about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ABdUmen9s">Windows Server and Docker</a> and upcoming features in the Windows Docker engine. </p>

<p>Another highlight for me after the conference was a visit at the Microsoft Campus in Redmond to meet the Windows Container team around Taylor Brown. After a meeting and having lunch we talked about making my Packer template for a <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/windows_2016_docker.json">Windows Server 2016 TP5 Docker VM</a> work with Hyper-V. At that time my packer template supported only VirtualBox and VMware with a <a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-local-windows-2016-tp5-docker-vm/">blog post describing how to build it</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/20160623_101541.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So Patrick Lang from Microsoft and I started to have a look at the pull request <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/pull/2576">mitchellh/packer#2576</a> by Taliesin Sisson that adds a Hyper-V builder to Packer. After a couple of days (already back to Germany working in different time zones) we improved the template through <a href="https://github.com/PatrickLang/packer-windows/commit/7e13d4799e28a3afb1e35b878e00394256011022">GitHub</a> and finally got it working.</p>

<h2 id="packerbuildvagrantup">packer build, vagrant up</h2>

<p>If you haven't heard about <a href="https://www.packer.io">Packer</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> let me explain it with the following diagram. If you want to create a VM from an ISO file you normally click through your hypervisor UI and then follow the installation steps inside the VM.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/packer_vagrant.png" alt="packer build, vagrant up"></p>

<p>With Packer you can automate that step building a VM from an ISO file, put all steps into a Packer template and then just share the template so others can just run</p>

<pre><code>packer build template.json  
</code></pre>

<p>In our case the output is a Vagrant box. That is a compressed VM ready to be used with the next tool - Vagrant. It takes a Vagrant box, creates a copy of it to turn it on so you can work again and again with the same predefined VM that was built by Packer. You want to turn your VM on? Just type</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>You want to stop the VM after work? Just type</p>

<pre><code>vagrant halt  
</code></pre>

<p>You want to try something out and want to undo all that to start over with the clean state. Just destroy it and start it again.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant destroy  
vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>There are much more commands and even snapshots can be used. The advantage is that you don't have to know all the buttons in your hypervisor. Both Packer and Vagrant are available for <strong>Windows, Mac and Linux</strong> and also <strong>support <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/multiprovider-vagrant">multiple hypervisors</a></strong> and even cloud providers.</p>

<p>So you only have to learn one or both of these tools and you're done if you have to work with VM's.</p>

<h2 id="addinghypervbuilder">Adding Hyper-V builder</h2>

<p>The Packer template for a VM has one or more builder sections. The Hyper-V section looks like this and contains the typical steps</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding files for a virtual floppy for the first boot</li>
<li>Defining disk size, memory and CPU's</li>
<li>How to login into the VM</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-json">    {
      "vm_name":"WindowsServer2016TP5Docker",
      "type": "hyperv-iso",
      "disk_size": 41440,
      "boot_wait": "0s",
      "headless": false,
      "guest_additions_mode":"disable",
      "iso_url": "{{user `iso_url`}}",
      "iso_checksum_type": "{{user `iso_checksum_type`}}",
      "iso_checksum": "{{user `iso_checksum`}}",
      "floppy_files": [
        "./answer_files/2016/Autounattend.xml",
        "./floppy/WindowsPowershell.lnk",
        "./floppy/PinTo10.exe",
        "./scripts/disable-winrm.ps1",
        "./scripts/docker/enable-winrm.ps1",
        "./scripts/microsoft-updates.bat",
        "./scripts/win-updates.ps1"
      ],
      "communicator":"winrm",
      "winrm_username": "vagrant",
      "winrm_password": "vagrant",
      "winrm_timeout" : "4h",
      "shutdown_command": "shutdown /s /t 10 /f /d p:4:1 /c \"Packer Shutdown\"",
      "ram_size_mb": 2048,
      "cpu": 2,
      "switch_name":"{{user `hyperv_switchname`}}",
      "enable_secure_boot":true
    },
</code></pre>

<p>Packer can also download ISO files from a download link to make automation very easy. </p>

<p>The installation of a Windows Server 2016 VM can be automated with an <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/answer_files/2016/Autounattend.xml"><code>Autounattend.xml</code></a> file. This file contains information to setup the Windows VM until the WinRM service is up and running and Packer can login from the host machine to run further provision scripts to setup the VM with additional installations.</p>

<p>In case of the Windows Server 2016 TP5 Docker VM we additionally <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/scripts/docker/install-docker.ps1">install Docker 1.12</a> and pull the Windows base OS docker images into the VM.</p>

<p>All these steps defined in the Packer template build a good Vagrant box to have Docker preinstalled with the base docker image as it takes some time to download it the first time.</p>

<p>So after a <code>vagrant destroy</code> you still have the Windows OS docker images installed and can work with a clean installation again. Only from time to time when there is a new OS docker image version you have to rebuild your Vagrant box with Packer.</p>

<h2 id="buildthehypervvagrantbox">Build the Hyper-V Vagrant box</h2>

<p>To build the Vagrant box locally on a Windows 10 machine you only need the <strong>Hyper-V feature</strong> activated and you need a <strong>special version of <code>packer.exe</code></strong> (notice: with <code>choco install packer</code> you only get the upstream packer where the hyperv builder is not integrated yet). The packer.exe with hyperv builder can be downloaded at <a href="https://dl.bintray.com/taliesins/Packer/">https://dl.bintray.com/taliesins/Packer/</a>.</p>

<p>Clone my packer template from GitHub and build it with these commands:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
packer build --only=hyperv-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>This will take some time downloading and caching the ISO file, booting, installing the software and pulling the first Docker images.</p>

<h2 id="sharevagrantboxeswithatlas">Share Vagrant boxes with Atlas</h2>

<p>Another advantage of Vagrant is that you can share Vagrant base boxes through Atlas, a service by HashiCorp. So only one has to run Packer and build the Vagrant box and provide it for other team members or the community.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/packer_vagrant_atlas.png" alt="packer atlas vagrant"></p>

<p>Others can create a <code>Vagrantfile</code> with the box name of one of the provided Vagrant boxes. That name will be used at the first <code>vagrant up</code> to download the correct Vagrant box for the hypervisor to be used.</p>

<p>Even Microsoft has its first <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Microsoft/boxes/EdgeOnWindows10">Vagrant box at Atlas</a> which can be used with VirtualBox only at the moment. But it is only a matter of time that more Hyper-V based Vagrant boxes will show up in Atlas, also boxes for other hypervisors.</p>

<p>If you don't have a Vagrantfile you even can create a simple one to start a new test environment with two commands and a suitable Vagrant box from Atlas.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant init Microsoft/EdgeOnWindows10  
vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant itself can log into the VM through WinRM and run further provision scripts to setup a good development or test environment. It is just a decision what to install in a Vagrant box with Packer and what to install with Vagrant afterwards. You decide which flexibility you want or if you prefer a faster <code>vagrant up</code> experience with a full provisioned Vagrant box that was built with a longer running Packer build once.</p>

<h2 id="dockerwindowsbox">docker-windows-box</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a test environment for Windows Docker containers you might have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box">docker-windows-box</a> GitHub repo that installs Git and some additional Docker tools to get started working on some <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">Windows Dockerfiles</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/docker-windows-box.png" alt="docker windows box"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I'm happy that there is a Hyper-V builder for Packer that really works. Vagrant already has a Hyper-V provider built in so you can have the same experience running and working with VM's as others have with VMware or VirtualBox.</p>

<p>With a such a TP5 Vagrant box it is very easy to get in touch with Windows Docker Containers, regardless if you are working on Windows 10 with Hyper-V or from your Mac or Linux machine with another hypervisor.</p>

This allows you to run Windows Containers directly in Windows 10 as Hyper-V containers. At the moment only NanoServer containers are supported. So it's time to get used to NanoServer and how to create some base images.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/windows10-containers-feature.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this blog post I'll show how to build small base images to deploy Node.js applications as NanoServer Docker images that you can run <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start_windows_10">in Windows 10</a> or in Windows Server 2016 TP5.</p>

<h2 id="whatisnanoserver">What is Nano Server?</h2>

<p>Each Docker image must use of of the two OS images: <code>windowsservercore</code> or <code>nanoserver</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Windows Server Core</strong> image is <strong>highly compatible</strong> with previous Windows Server Core installations. You don't have a GUI, but you can install almost everything into it. But this compatibility comes with a prize, the size of the OS image is about 9.3 GByte as it contains about a whole server.</p>

<p>A <strong>Nano Server</strong> image is <strong>highly optimized</strong> and almost everything was taken out of it to be able to deploy more of these containers in cloud servers. The size is about 817 MByte. This makes installing Docker on Windows 10 much faster than with the <code>windowsservercore</code> OS image.</p>

<p>So if you get asked which to choose you probably would answer to take the smaller one.</p>

<h2 id="thechallengemsipackages">The challenge: MSI packages</h2>

<p>But as soon as you try to write a <code>Dockerfile</code> to install some software into a Docker image you will notice that the minimized OS comes with a new challenge. <strong>You can't install MSI packages in Nano Server.</strong></p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a> there are only MSI packages for Windows if you also want to have npm installed.</p>

<p>So how could we build a Node.js Docker image based on Nano Server? I've tried different ways, eg. also installing tools like lessmsi while building the Nano Server image only to find out that lessmsi is only a 32 bit application. Another restriction in Nano Server: <strong>You only can run 64 bit processes in Nano Server.</strong></p>

<p>Another approach would be installing Node.js on your host machine and copying the files into the Docker image. But I don't want to install more tools than needed on a Docker host.</p>

<p>Therefore I show you a way to use only Docker commands and a Windows Server 2016 TP5 machine to build both Windows Server Core image as well as a Nano Server image with Node.js + npm installed.</p>

<h3 id="step1installmsiintowindowsservercoreimage">Step 1 - Install MSI into Windows Server Core image</h3>

<p>A much easier way is to start with a Windows Server Core image. You can download and install the Node.js MSI package with this <code>Dockerfile</code>. This is very similar to the Linux version and downloads, verifies the download, installs the package and then removes the download again.</p>

<p>Now open an editor with</p>

<pre><code>notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and enter this <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM windowsservercore

ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL info  
ENV NODE_VERSION 4.4.5  
ENV NODE_SHA256 7b2409605c871a40d60c187bd24f6f6ddf10590df060b7d905ef46b3b3aa7f81

RUN powershell -Command \  
    wget -Uri https://nodejs.org/dist/v%NODE_VERSION%/node-v%NODE_VERSION%-x64.msi -OutFile node.msi -UseBasicParsing ; \
    if ((Get-FileHash node.msi -Algorithm sha256).Hash -ne $env:NODE_SHA256) {exit 1} ; \
    Start-Process -FilePath msiexec -ArgumentList /q, /i, node.msi -Wait ; \
    Remove-Item -Path node.msi

CMD [ "node.exe" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>You can build the Node.js Docker image with this command</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t node:4.4.5 .  
</code></pre>

<p>After that you have Node.js + npm installed in this Docker image.</p>

<h3 id="step2distillnodejsfolder">Step 2 - Distill Node.js folder</h3>

<p>Now we want to distill the Node.js folder from the Docker image. To do that we have to run a Docker container and then we can copy the folder to a temporary folder on the host machine.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name=node-temp node:4.4.5 node --version  
docker cp "node-temp:c:\Program Files\nodejs" nodejs  
docker rm -vf node-temp  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="step3copydeploytonanoserverimage">Step 3 - COPY deploy to Nano Server image</h3>

<p>With this extracted folder we build the Nano Server image. The following <code>Dockerfile</code> copies the contents of that temporary folder into the Windows directory which is already in PATH. You may want to put the files in another directory, but then you also have to add it to the <code>PATH</code> environment.</p>

<p>Create a sub folder for the Nano Dockerfile</p>

<pre><code>mkdir nano  
notepad nano\Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and create this <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM nanoserver

COPY nodejs /windows/system32

CMD [ "node.exe" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command to build the Nano Server image</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t node:4.4.5-nano nano  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have two Docker images, one for Windows Server Core and one for Nano Server.</p>

<p>Here is a small diagram of the three steps we just did:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/nodejs_nanoserver-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I've uploaded both Docker images to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/node-windows/tags/">Docker Hub</a> and found out that the Windows Server Core image is about <strong>55 MByte</strong> and the Nano Server image is only <strong>9 MByte</strong>.</p>

<p>Extracting all the layers of the first Docker image I found out that installing an MSI package also saves a copy of the package in the MSI cache. And running commands also leaves some changes in local databases and the registry which is also stored as difference in the layer.</p>

<p>So one advice to build small Windows Docker images is to avoid installing MSI packages and prefer ZIP files or even using a COPY deployment into an image. Of course MSI packages are often more convenient to install but result in bigger image sizes.</p>

<h2 id="buildappwithonbuild">Build app with ONBUILD</h2>

<p>Another easy way to dockerize your Node.js application is the <code>ONBUILD</code> feature in the <code>Dockerfile</code>. At least for simple examples it is very convenient to use a prepared Docker images with that feature.</p>

<p>So let's build another <code>Dockerfile</code> just like the official <code>node:onbuild</code> image which does these steps to install your application and all the dependencies:</p>

<ol>
<li>copy package.json  </li>
<li>run npm install  </li>
<li>copy rest of sources</li>
</ol>

<p>So we create another folder for that <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code>mkdir nano\onbuild  
notepad nano\onbuild\Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and the following content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM node:4.4.5-nano

RUN mkdir \app  
WORKDIR /app

ONBUILD COPY package.json package.json  
ONBUILD RUN npm install  
ONBUILD COPY . .

CMD [ "npm.cmd", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the Nano Server image with the ONBUILD feature:</p>

<pre><code>docker build --isolation=hyperv -t node:4.4.5-nano-onbuild nano/onbuild  
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested this with a small Node.js web server that uses Express and some other dependencies.</p>

<p>To build a dockerized Node.js application running in a Nano Server container you only have to go to your Node.js source code and add a single line <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM nano:4.4.5-nano-onbuild  
</code></pre>

<p>and build your application Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build --isolation=hyperv -t mynodeapp:nano .  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h2>

<p>Investigating the layers of such an application showed some other temporary folders which aren't needed inside the Docker image.</p>

<ol>
<li>A npm-cache folder  </li>
<li>Many files in temp folder, also from npm</li>
</ol>

<p>So we can optimize that ONBUILD <code>Dockerfile</code> a little bit to remove these temp folders while building your application Docker image. There is a command <code>npm cache clean</code>, but this didn't work for me, so I have changed that to some <code>rd</code> commands. This is the final ONBUILD <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM node:4.4.5-nano

RUN mkdir \app  
WORKDIR /app

ONBUILD COPY package.json package.json  
ONBUILD RUN npm install &amp; rd /s /q %APPDATA%\npm-cache &amp; for /d %G in ("%TEMP%\npm-*") do rd /s /q "%~G"  
ONBUILD COPY . .

CMD [ "npm.cmd", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>With that optimized Docker image deploying a simple Express web server the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/hello-dresden/tags/">final application Docker image</a> went down from <strong>24 MByte</strong> to <strong>15 MByte</strong>. In comparison with the unoptimized Windows Server Core image the same application is <strong>82 MByte</strong> on the Docker Hub.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you don't want to build these Node.js Docker images manually you can find them on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/node-windows/">Docker Hub</a> with links to the Dockerfiles in the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/node">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>With such a Node.js Nano Server base image on the Docker Hub you can start developing on your Windows 10 machine. Now dockerize your Node.js apps into Nano Server containers and share them with others via the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>The Windows Server 2016 is only needed to install MSI packages and distill the software into Nano Server images.</p>

The latest Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 is a good starting point to see the current state of the Docker Engine running on Windows and get in touch with Windows Containers.</p>

<p>Very soon there will be a Microsoft Azure template to get started very easily. Another simple way will be creating a Docker Machine in Azure, once a <a href="https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/3329">pull request</a> is merged.</p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>But for now it takes some effort and time to set up such a local VM. There are good tutorials that guide you through all the steps needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/setup-docker-windows-server-2016">Setup Docker on Windows Server 2016 in VirtualBox</a> by Arun Gupta</li>
<li><a href="https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2016/04/30/windows-docker-containers/">Windows Docker Containers in Hyper-V</a> by Gabriel Schenker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="packervagrantautomation">Packer + Vagrant = Automation</h2>

<p>If you don't want to do all these whole setup manually and wait in front of your computer to enter the next step you can use Packer and Vagrant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.packer.io">Packer</a> takes the ISO file and bakes a base box VM to be used with <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. With Vagrant you can spin up one ore more such VM's and even form a Windows Docker Swarm.</p>

<p>The Packer template to create a Windows 2016 TP5 VM including the Docker Engine is tested with VirtualBox 5.0.20 and VMware Fusion 8.1 and should also work with VMware Workstation if you are working with a Windows PC.</p>

<h3 id="runpacker">Run Packer</h3>

<p>To build the Vagrant base box with Packer 0.10.0 you just clone the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the Vagrant base box for VMware</p>

<pre><code>packer build --only=vmware-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>or for VirtualBox.</p>

<pre><code>packer build --only=virtualbox-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>This takes about an hour, so you can leave your computer for a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/packer-build.png" alt="packer-build"></p>

<p>After that a box file should be created in the current directory. Now add this box to Vagrant with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_2016_tp5_docker windows_2016_docker_vmware.box  
</code></pre>

<p>If you have both hypervisors, you also can create both base boxes and add them. You can list all your base boxes with</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant box list
windows_2016_tp5_docker (virtualbox, 0)  
windows_2016_tp5_docker (vmware_desktop, 0)  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="runvagrant">Run Vagrant</h2>

<p>Now you can create test and dev scenarios with this new base box. There is <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box">another GitHub</a> repo for that. We just clone it with</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box  
cd docker-windows-box  
</code></pre>

<p>With the current Vagrant 1.8.1 it is easy to spin up a VM to have Docker running on Windows 2016 TP5.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant powers up a VM and install further Docker tools like Machine and Compose. Also Git will be installed to get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/brogersyh/Dockerfiles-for-windows">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-container-samples/windowsservercore">Windows</a> <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">Dockerfiles</a> available on GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/vagrant-up-1.png" alt="vagrant-up"></p>

<p>You can open a PowerShell window and run for example</p>

<pre><code>docker version  
docker images  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/docker-version.png" alt="docker-version"></p>

<p>Congratulations! You can start working with a brand new Docker Engine running on Windows 2016 TP5.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<h2 id="whatpackerdoesforyou">What Packer does for you</h2>

<p>If you want to understand what Packer does building such a VM in an automated way here is a list of provision scripts that Packer runs.</p>

<h3 id="installfeatures">Install features</h3>

<p>In the script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/enable-winrm.ps1">enable-winrm.ps1</a>, just before the WinRM port will be opened to let Packer login and do further provisioning some Windows features like Containers and Hyper-V (only VMware) will be enabled.</p>

<h3 id="installdocker">Install Docker</h3>

<p>The next script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/install-docker.ps1">install-docker.ps1</a> installs the Docker service and client and the <code>windowsservercore</code> base Docker image. If Hyper-V is enabled, also the <code>nanoserver</code> base Docker images will be installed.</p>

<h3 id="patchwindowsservercoreimage">Patch windowsservercore image</h3>

<p>As the TP5 and relating files and images are very fresh and it is still a technical preview, there might be some obstacles here and there.</p>

<p>At the moment <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/e2751260-4494-4b60-999e-5ea27ccbe1db/workaround-to-increase-boot-time-for-windows-server-core-containers?forum=windowscontainers">we need this script</a> to speed up the <code>windowsservercore</code> Docker image a little bit. The script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/patch-boot-time-for-containers.ps1">patch-boot-time-for-containers.ps1</a> just fixes that for you.</p>

<h3 id="enableinsecuredockerport2375">Enable insecure Docker port 2375</h3>

<p>For a local test environment we also just open the insecure Docker port 2375 with the script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/enable-docker-insecure.ps1">enable-docker-insecure.ps1</a>. <br>
You can remote control your Windows Docker engine from your host machine that is running the VM. Try it out, especially if you are normally working with Linux or Mac.</p>

<p>Once there is a Docker Machine driver for local Windows VM's is available I would prefer that and have the secure TLS connection.</p>

<h3 id="adddockergroup">Add docker group</h3>

<p>The new Windows Docker engine listens to a Windows named pipe. This is very similar to the Unix socket on Linux.</p>

<p>A normal user does not have access to it, so you have to open an administrator shell to work with the Docker engine.</p>

<p>The script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/add-docker-group.ps1">add-docker-group.ps1 <br>
</a> adds the option <code>-G docker</code> to the Docker engine to give all members of the Windows group <code>docker</code> access to that named pipe.</p>

<p>The script also adds the user <code>vagrant</code> to that group. So in the final Vagrant box you just open a normal PowerShell window and can use the Docker engine.</p>

<h3 id="removekeyjson">Remove key.json</h3>

<p>The final script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/remove-docker-key-json.ps1">remove-docker-key-json.ps1 <br>
</a> removes the <code>key.json</code> file from the initial installation. This file will be created on the first start of the Docker engine in each Vagrant VM and creates different ID's for each Docker engine.</p>

<p>This is important if you want to build a Windows Docker Swarm. Each Docker engine needs a different ID.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As there might be updates in the Docker base images and the Docker engine itself it is now very easy to reproduce the base VM with Packer and Vagrant without all the manual steps again.</p>

Sure I had to get in touch with that new toy as soon as possible to see what has changed since TP4 that was released in November 2015.</p>

<p>As I haven't found an Azure template (<strong>update:</strong> today I found <a href="https://portal.azure.com/?feature.intlpolyfill=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryFeaturedMenuItemBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home/searchQuery/Windows%20Server%202016%20Technical%20Preview%205">Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5</a>), I prepared my packer templates in <a href="https://github.com/stefanscherer/packer-windows/tree/tp5">a tp5 branch</a> that still need some changes to automatically build and install Docker and the Docker base images.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-27-um-21-18-51.png" alt="packer build"></p>

<p>Even without a 100% solution this was a good first starting point build a first Vagrant box to start with and to do the remaining steps from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/deployment/deployment?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">Container Host Deployment - Windows Server</a> manually.</p>

<p>I'm really addicted to the automation workflow</p>

<ol>
<li><code>packer build</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant box add</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant up</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant destroy -f</code></li>
</ol>

<p>because you won't do it only once to build and have such a test environment. But setting it up is the hard way.</p>

<p>If you are impatient to wait for a complete packer template you can follow Arun Gupta's steps to build a <a href="http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/setup-docker-windows-server-2016">TP5 VM in VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's see what's new in the Technical Preview 5.</p>

<h2 id="wayfasternomoresleep">Way faster - no more sleep</h2>

<p>Building some Docker images with one of the Windows Dockerfiles I tested with TP4 are now <strong>much faster</strong> and as well you do not need to do the workaround of sleeping some seconds in each <code>RUN</code> command. Just remove this and forget about it.</p>

<h2 id="ipadressescanbeinspected">IP adresses can be inspected</h2>

<p>One of the obstacles porting the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-birthday-3/pull/165">Docker Birthday app to TP4 Windows containers</a> was the missing ability to fetch the IP adress of each container.</p>

<p>Running <code>docker inspect</code> now shows the IP address of the container.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-27-um-22-33-29.png" alt="container ip address"></p>

<p>I will have to test whether the links in a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file will work as well to set up a simple multi container app using simple host names.</p>

<p>But that's a good improvement of the networking in Windows containers.</p>

<h2 id="npipeisyourunixsocket">npipe is your unix socket</h2>

<p>Another interesting thing is that the Docker engine now listens to a Windows named pipe, just like a Unix socket on Linux.</p>

<p>This leads to a very unixish behavior that you have to be "sudo" to run docker commands:</p>

<p>Running the docker client without adminstratotion rights you can't connect to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-28-um-00-01-29.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is a way to allow specific users to use this named pipe just like on Linux adding users to the docker group, but I haven't found out the group name for this short test.</p>

<h2 id="kitematicmeetswindowsagain">Kitematic meets Windows (again)</h2>

<p>At this evening I also played with Docker for Windows Beta in a parallel VM and installed Kitematic there. As the Beta uses Kitematic without VirtualBox I thought this should also work well with TP5. So I took the ZIP file from the Beta download and tweaked my TP5 installation a little bit to make Kitematic talk to the Window Docker Engine.</p>

<p>My very pragmatic way to make this work was to add the local TCP port 2375 to the Docker Engine by editing the start script</p>

<pre><code>notepad C:\ProgramData\docker\runDockerDaemon.cmd  
</code></pre>

<p>and change the dockerd command to <code>dockerd -H npipe:// -H 127.0.0.1:2375</code> and then run</p>

<pre><code>restart-service docker  
</code></pre>

<p>The downloaded version of Kitematic for the Beta also searches for <code>docker.local</code>, so I added the loopback IP address to the host table with</p>

<pre><code class="language- ">notepad C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-28-um-00-23-13.png" alt="kitematic-on-tp5"></p>

<p>Now Kitematic starts up without creating a local VM and shows the local Windows containers on the left side.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to explore in TP5 as you now can <strong>pull and push</strong> Docker Images from and to the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>So stay tuned of upcoming blog posts. With the TP5 the community can follow the progress of Docker on Windows much better and can check the latest improvements and pull requests of the Windows Docker Engine.</p>

That tutorial just used a prebuilt Swarm Docker image that was loaded from local disk.</p>

<p>Some people asked me how I have built that container image. Assuming you have a Windows Server 2016 TP4 machine you nowadays need nothing more than the right Dockerfiles to do this.</p>

<p>So let's start writing a <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Docker Swarm inside a Docker container. For the next steps open a PowerShell window and then open an editor.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">notepad Dockerfile.builder  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="useabaseimage">Use a base image</h3>

<p>Swarm is written in Go, so we look for a useful base image. And there already is one useful base image in the <strong>Docker Hub</strong>. So we begin the Dockerfile with the following line.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM microsoft/golang  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installgit">Install Git</h3>

<p>Additionally to Go we also need Git installed inside the Container image. So we use the following lines that will download and install Git for Windows and then remove the installer again. As a further step we add Git to the <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV GIT_VERSION 2.7.2

RUN powershell -Command \  
    Sleep 2 ; \
    wget https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v%GIT_VERSION%.windows.1/Git-%GIT_VERSION%-64-bit.exe -outfile gitinstaller.exe ; \
    Start-Process .\gitinstaller.exe -ArgumentList '/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /DIR=c:\git' -Wait ; \
    rm .\gitinstaller.exe

RUN setx PATH %PATH%;C:\git\cmd;C:\git\bin;C:\git\usr\bin  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installandbuildgodepandswarm">Install and build Godep and Swarm</h3>

<p>The Swarm project uses <code>Godep</code> to manage the dependencies. We also need this tool as well as the Swarm sources. So let's install both and run the <code>godep</code> tool to build the <code>swarm.exe</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV SWARM_VERSION v1.1.3  
ENV GOPATH C:/go

WORKDIR /go

RUN powershell -Command \  
    Sleep 2 ; \
    go get github.com/tools/godep ; \
    mkdir src\github.com\docker ; \
    cd src\github.com\docker ; \
    git clone https://github.com/docker/swarm ; \
    cd swarm ; \
    git checkout %SWARM_VERSION% ; \
    Start-Process -FilePath godep.exe -ArgumentList go, install, . -Wait
</code></pre>

<p>Now save the <code>Dockerfile.builder</code> file and close the editor.</p>

<p>Back in the PowerShell build the Docker image with the name <code>swarm-builder</code> and the given Dockerfile with the following command.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">docker build -t swarm-builder -f Dockerfile.builder .  
</code></pre>

<p>This now creates a Docker image with multiple layers, for each <code>ENV</code> and <code>RUN</code> command in the <code>Dockerfile</code>. You can see the actions on your screen and finally the command finishes and you can list your images with</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a image with the name <code>swarm-builder</code>:</p>

<pre><code>REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE  
swarm-builder       latest              04e557dd075a        31 minutes ago      1.219 GB  
</code></pre>

<p>The size of the Docker image is not good for deployment as we have all the development tools and source codes inside it.</p>

<h3 id="testandextracttheswarmexe">Test and extract the swarm.exe</h3>

<p>We only need the <code>swarm.exe</code> from this image as it is a static binary. So we just run the Docker image and have a very little test of the binary just created by showing its version.</p>

<p>After that we copy the <code>swarm.exe</code> from the container back to the host.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name swarm-builder swarm-builder swarm --version  
docker cp swarm-builder:/go/bin/swarm.exe ./swarm.exe  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="buildasmallswarmimage">Build a small Swarm image</h3>

<p>The final Docker image for deployment can be produced with a much simpler <code>Dockerfile</code>. As the time of writing the Technical Preview 4 needs a small workaround to access the network inside a container. We have to add a small helper script for now.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">nodepad run.ps1  
</code></pre>

<p>The small PowerShell script just sleeps a little and then calls <code>swarm.exe</code> with the arguments given.</p>

<pre><code>Sleep 2  
\swarm.exe $args
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is time to write the <code>Dockerfile</code>. So open an editor with the following command. Notice the dot '.' as this helps Notepad create a <code>Dockerfile</code> without an extension.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> now uses the <code>windowsservercore</code> base image and copies the helper script and the swarm binary into the image and sets the entrypoint.</p>

<pre><code>FROM windowsservercore

COPY ./swarm.exe /swarm.exe  
COPY ./run.ps1 /run.ps1

ENV SWARM_HOST :2375

ENTRYPOINT ["powershell.exe", "-File", "/run.ps1"]  
CMD ["--help"]  
</code></pre>

<p>We now build the final Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t swarm .  
</code></pre>

<p>Just check the size of the Docker images again with</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-images.png" alt="docker images"></p>

<p>If you build a new version of the Swarm image later it is useful to tag each Docker image with its version. For this tutorial we have built Swarm 1.1.3, so we tag it with</p>

<pre><code>docker tag swarm:latest swarm:1.1.3  
</code></pre>

<p>You now can run a Swarm container eg. with</p>

<pre><code>docker run -it swarm:1.1.3 --version  
</code></pre>

<p>and you will see the version of the <code>swarm.exe</code>.</p>

<h3 id="automateallthethings">Automate all the things</h3>

<p>Both the Dockerfiles and a build script can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/swarm">dockerfiles-windows</a> GitHub repo. Even to download the sources you do not need more than a PowerShell window. Just download it as a ZIP and extract it:</p>

<pre><code>wget -outfile src.zip https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/archive/master.zip  
Expand-Archive .\dockerfiles-windows.zip  
</code></pre>

<p>The steps to build both the development Docker image as well the final image is added to a small build script which can be run with this commands</p>

<pre><code>cd src\dockerfiles-windows-master\swarm  
.\build.bat
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tldr">TL/DR</h3>

<p>Even on Windows you now can put development environments into Docker images and build small images for deployment with a two step approach. No special setup is needed on your host machine, just Docker should be reachable.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is reproducable</strong> on every team members machines. And a CI build pipeline can take advantage of this dockerized setup as well.</p>

<p>I hope you get a feeling what you can do with your own software project and <strong>start dockerizing</strong> as well.</p>

In this blog post I explain how to set up a Windows Docker Swarm. I use this setup for demonstration purposes, so the VM's are running locally on my laptop.</p>

<p>At the time of writing there is no docker-machine driver to create the Windows Docker VM's. And my laptop at work is still running with Windows 7, so I have chosen VirtualBox as a local hypervisor instead of Hyper-V.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/windows_swarm_demo.png" alt="Network diagram"></p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram there also is a private Docker registry. I just want to show you that saving and restoring Windows Docker images is just as easy as on Linux.</p>

<p>A laptop with 16GB memory is capable of running this setup. With less memory, just run only two of the Windows VM's and reduce the memory setting.</p>

<h2 id="setupyourhost">Setup your host</h2>

<p>If you like to follow this tutorial you need some tools on your host machine. Pleas keep in mind that VirtualBox does not work with Hyper-V on the same machine. My preferred way to setup a Windows machine is by install the software with <a href="https://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a>. So these are the steps needed for the host tools:</p>

<pre><code>iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))  
choco install -y virtualbox  
choco install -y vagrant  
choco install -y packer  
choco install -y docker  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="buildthevagrantbox">Build the Vagrant box</h2>

<p>Before spinning up the swarm you have to build the Windows Server 2016 VM with Docker installed. As I'm a big fan of automation I do not click through the installers, but use <a href="https://packer.io">Packer</a> and <a href="https://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to build and run local VM's.</p>

<p>Before running Packer you should register to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview">technical preview evaluation</a> and accept the license for the Windows Server ISO file.</p>

<p>After that just clone my Packer templates and build the VirtualBox VM with</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
packer build --only=virtualbox-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>Now add the Vagrant box to the local list of baseboxes with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_2016_docker windows_2016_docker_virtualbox.box  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="buildthedockerswarm">Build the Docker swarm</h2>

<p>The next step is also very easy. We clone <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box/tree/master/swarm-demo">the repo</a> with the Vagrantfile for the Docker swarm and spin up all boxes.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box  
cd docker-windows-box  
cd swarm-demo  
vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
</code></pre>

<p>One after another the VM's are booted and provisioned with the shell scripts provided in the <code>scripts</code> folder.</p>

<h4 id="registry">registry</h4>

<p>The Linux box <code>registry</code> is used for the Docker Swarm manager and a Docker registry.</p>

<ol>
<li>The swarm manager is using a token in <code>config/swarm-token</code>. Edit this as you like.  </li>
<li>The registry is using the <code>registry-v2</code> folder on your host to store the Docker images.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="swwin01">sw-win-01 ...</h4>

<p>The Windows Server 2016 TP4 machines that spin up a Swarm container to join the Docker Swarm. The Docker Engines have a connection to the insecure registry running at <code>registry:5000</code>.</p>

<h2 id="upandrunning">Up and running</h2>

<p>After a while all VM's are up and running and you can see the status with <code>vagrant status</code></p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/vagrant-status.png" alt="vagrant status"></p>

<p>The Docker Swarm is built and all Windows VM's have joined the swarm. You can check this by connecting with the Docker Client to the Swarm Manager.</p>

<pre><code>docker -H tcp://192.168.38.100:3375 info  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-info.png" alt="docker info"></p>

<h2 id="runcontainersintheswarm">Run containers in the swarm</h2>

<p>For a very simple demo we now run three containers that are spread over all three Windows Docker Swarm agents.</p>

<pre><code>docker -H tcp://192.168.38.100:3375 run -d windowsservercore powershell -Command sleep 60  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-run.png" alt="docker run"></p>

<p>As you can see the containers are running on all different Docker nodes <code>sw-win-01</code> ... <code>sw-win-03</code>.</p>

<p>With the local registry you can push and pull Windows images from it and safe your work. The registry files are stored at your host so it is safe to destroy all VM's if you do not use them.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial. In a future blog post I probably show how to build a Windows Docker Swarm in Azure or in Hyper-V.</p>

But does Docker run on 32bit Intel CPU's as well?</p>

<h2 id="whytheheck">Why the heck?</h2>

<p>Weeks ago when I wrote some integration tests for <code>docker-machine</code> to test the Chocolatey package on AppVeyor CI and I thought: Wouldn't it be cool to create eg. a real VirtualBox Docker Machine on a CI server and have some real tests there? But I soon found out that most/all of the CI servers out in the cloud also are virtualized. And none really supports what's called <strong>nested hypervisor</strong> - to run a 64bit VM in a 64bit VM. I left the integration tests with some tests with the driver <code>none</code> and forgot about the idea.</p>

<p>Last week I sat before my old PC running 32bit Windows and I thought if it is possible to run Docker on it as well. I normally use <code>docker-machine</code> to spin up Docker from Windows in a Linux boot2docker VM. And with Chocolatey I can install the 32bit Windows version of <code>docker-machine</code>. But spinning up a VirtualBox Docker Machine doesn't work on my PC as it can't run 64bit VM's. So the idea came back into my mind.</p>

<p>So what is missing to create such a 32bit VM to have at least a running Docker Engine?</p>

<ul>
<li>a 32bit Docker Engine binary for x86 CPU</li>
<li>a 32bit boot2docker.iso file that is used by <code>docker-machine</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So I first searched for some issues on GitHub what others said about 32bit Docker.</p>

<p>I found this interesting Issue <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/136">docker/docker#136</a> with a comment by Solomon Hykes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's what I suggest:</p>
  
  <p>Step 1: docker only supports amd64. It will refuse to start a container on any other architecture.This should be made clear to the user.</p>
  
  <p>Step 2: docker will eventually support more architectures, including i386. This will include arch-specific images, facilities to look them up etc.</p>
  
  <p>So, I will accept anything that makes it easier to support multiple architectures <em>in the future</em>. But for now we're sticking to amd64.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last sentence made me smile. Hey, aren't we doing multi architecture right now? Is the future now?</p>

<p>I started a proof of concept, but didn't want to waste disk space and computing power locally. So I also tested if such a task could be done right from your web browser. Just fork the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">docker/docker</a> repo and start patching the <code>Dockerfile</code> to build it for 32bit. Then fork the <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker">boot2docker/boot2docker</a> repo as well and do the same thing here. To build the DEB package and the ISO file I used TravisCI and deployed the output as a GitHub release to the forked repo.</p>

<p>So my build pipeline looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker_build_pipeline-png-shadow.png" alt="boot2docker build pipeline"></p>

<p>I created two pull requests against the forked repos to have the TravisCI build status for each commit. And also we can diff the modified files very easily in the browser.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker/pull/1">docker/pull/1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/pull/1">boot2docker/pull/1</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the afternoon my kids wanted to play some computer games, so I had to leave my MacBook and PC. But no problem with this setup, I just continued on my iPad.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-ipad.jpg" alt="committing from iPad"></p>

<p>Porting the <code>Dockerfile</code> from amd64 to another CPU you first have to solve the <code>FROM ubuntu:trusty</code> line and find a base image. Crazy enough there already are some 32bit Docker Image, so I just could use <code>FROM 32bit/ubuntu:14.04</code> instead.</p>

<p>And step by step I ported packages, filenames, directory names to fit the i386 architecture. <br>
For the boot2docker the problem was to compile a 32bit kernel first, but a <code>make menuconfig</code> is your friend to change all the kernel switches needed to turn off 64bit.</p>

<h2 id="willitwork">Will it work?</h2>

<p>And after the ISO file was finished I tried it with an <code>appveyor.yml</code> to build a integration test for the Chocolatey package on a Windows CI server. There are some technical details to solve right now to install VirtualBox inside the build server without network issues.</p>

<p>So I tested it manually in an AppVeyor CI server through a RDP session. I installed VirtualBox with Chocolatey and then downloaded the 32bit boot2docker.iso file from the GitHub release and started up a boot2docker VM right in AppVeyor:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-in-appveyor.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<p>And does it run containers? Yes, pulling the <code>32bit/ubuntu:14.04</code> Docker image and running it also works inside the AppVeyor CI server:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-run-container.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<p><strong>Update 2016/02/27</strong>: Setting a specific NIC type works for AppVeyor and finally proofs that <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/StefanScherer/boot2docker/build/44">starting a Docker Machine VM in AppVeyor works</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/blob/x86/appveyor.yml">appveyor.yml</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="tryityourself">Try it yourself</h2>

<p>You can try the 32bit version of Docker yourself on your laptop by creating a VM with <code>docker-machine</code> and adjusting some defaults:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.10.1-386/boot2docker.iso dev32  
</code></pre>

<p>There is a preview of version 1.9.1 and 1.10.1. Here is the output of <code>docker version</code> running from my Mac against the 32bit Linux Docker Engine running in VirtualBox:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-version-1.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<h2 id="nestedvm">"Nested" VM?</h2>

<p>We can do another crazy thing with it. VirtualBox is not able to run nested 64bit VM's. But with this 32bit boot2docker it is possible to run the boot2docker VM inside a VirtualBox VM: </p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/container_in_virtualbox_in_virtualbox_on_mac-2.png" alt="nested-virtualbox"></p>

<p>I used this <code>Vagrantfile</code> to create the 64bit VirtualBox VM</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|  
  config.vm.box = "boxcutter/ubuntu1404"
  config.vm.network "public_network"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "2048"
  end
end  
</code></pre>

<p>Now spin up the VM and log into it with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
vagrant ssh  
</code></pre>

<p>Now inside the 64bit VM you install the Docker client, VirtualBox and Docker Machine with a patch to really disable VT-X checks. Future versions of Docker Machine will allow you to do that as pull request <a href="https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/3018">#3018</a> got merged recently.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update  
curl https://get.docker.com | sudo sh  
sudo apt-get install -y virtualbox  
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.9.1-386/docker-machine-Linux-x86_64  
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine  
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is time again to create the 32bit Docker Machine VM with</p>

<pre><code>docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-no-vtx-check --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.10.1-386/boot2docker.iso dev  
eval $(docker-machine env dev)  
docker version  
docker-machine ls  
docker run -it 32bit/ubuntu:14.04 bash  
</code></pre>

<p>This proof of concept shows that running Docker in a 32bit VM really could work. And it enables you to experiment a little more. But keep in mind that this is not officially supported and extremely experimental.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little tour. As always I love to get feedback. What is your use case to run Docker on 32bit?

But this time with the Windows Docker Engine in mind. In this blog post I show you how to run a Windows Docker Engine in a VM in Azure.</p>

<p>The Docker Engine has an API that is compatible between all platforms. So you can even work from your Linux, Mac or Windows notebook and build and run Windows Containers in that remote VM.</p>

<p>So let's get started. The Windows Docker Engine is a work in progress, but it's really worth to have a closer look at it right now. It is available with the Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 4, or TP4 for short.</p>

<p>To avoid building own VM's locally or installing it on bare metal we just use the prebuilt TP4 VM in Azure.</p>

<h3 id="justwithaclick">Just with a click</h3>

<p>A really nice feature is the <strong>Deploy to Azure</strong> button. I have found a good template at the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates">azure-quickstart-templates</a> repo and enhanced it a little bit to have more Docker tools pre-installed. For details have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-azure">docker-windows-azure</a> repo.</p>

<p>If you have an account for Microsoft Azure you can click on the following button to create the VM with this template. And if not, there also is a short trial period where you can test-drive Azure for some weeks.</p>

<p><a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FStefanScherer%2Fdocker-windows-azure%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"> <br>
    <img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png">
</a></p>

<h3 id="azurecli">Azure CLI</h3>

<p>If you have the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/xplat-cli-install/">Azure CLI</a> installed you also can spin up the Windows Docker Engine VM from the command line.</p>

<p>The command takes the JSON template file from the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-azure">docker-windows-azure</a> repo and adds the parameters that are needed to customize the VM and in which region it should be started.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">azure group deployment create Group docker-tp4 \  
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-azure/master/azuredeploy.json \
  -p '{
    "adminUsername": {"value": "docker"},
    "adminPassword": {"value": "Super$ecretPass123"},
    "dnsNameForPublicIP": {"value": "docker-tp4"},
    "VMName": {"value": "docker-tp4"},
    "location": {"value": "West US"}
    }'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="connecttothewindowsdockerengine">Connect to the Windows Docker Engine</h2>

<p>Now that the VM is up and running in Azure we want to use it. So we have to connect to the Windows Docker Engine.</p>

<p>There are several ways to do that.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>RDP</strong> to connect to the VM and use the Command Shell there to run docker commands locally in the VM.</li>
<li>Use <strong>WinRM</strong> to login to the VM. This connection is protected with a self-signed certifcate that is created on startup. But I had some trouble with the Go/Ruby WinRM clients for OSX, so I also added OpenSSH.</li>
<li>Use <strong>SSH</strong> to login to the VM. Just grab the FQDN or the IP of the VM and ssh into it. Then you also can run docker commands locally in the VM. Add your public SSH key for password-less logins.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Docker API</strong> running at HTTP port 2375 to connect from your notebook. Then you can remote control the Windows Docker Engine from your Windows, Linux or Mac client.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="remotedockerapi">Remote Docker API</h2>

<p>I'll show you the last method of the list to connect your local Docker client to the remote Windows Docker Engine.</p>

<p>Please notice that using the <strong>unsecure HTTP port 2375</strong> is not recommended. Securing the Docker port with a TLS certificate is part of a future blog post. There also is some good advice in <a href="http://blogsprajeesh.blogspot.de/2015/09/docker-for-windows-on-azure-vm-securing.html">Docker for windows on Azure VM : Securing the host and TLS</a> from Prajeesh Prathap.</p>

<p>I hope that <code>docker-machine</code> can do this step for you in the near future. It can generate such certs and upload them as well can help you setting the environment variables for the Docker Client.</p>

<p>But for now we just set the environment variables manually.</p>

<p>You need the full qualified domain name (FQDN) of your VM in Azure or at least the public IP address. In combination with the <code>azure</code> cli you can retrieve the IP address and set all the environments in a Linux/Mac/Cygwin shell with the following commands.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">unset DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME  
unset DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY  
unset DOCKER_CERT_PATH  
export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$(azure vm show Group docker-tp4 | grep "Public IP address" | cut -d : -f 3):2375  
</code></pre>

<p>The three <code>unset</code> commands are just for the case that you already use <code>docker-machine</code> with TLS for some other VM's or machines in the Cloud. This just turns off the TLS checks in the Docker Client for now to connect to the Windows Docker Engine. <br>
For other shells like PowerShell or CMD shell it is the same. Just delete all DOCKER_ environment variables and set the <code>DOCKER_HOST</code> environment variable to <code>tcp://ip-of-your-tp4-vm:2375</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can check that the Docker Client really talks to our new Windows Docker Engine. So check which Docker images are available with this command</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p>And yes, there is the <code>windowsservercore</code> Docker image which is the base image to work with Docker on Windows.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/Bildschirmfoto-2016-02-01-um-08-43-33.png" alt="docker-images"></p>

<p>Now it is time to run the first Windows Docker container. We just run an interactive container to get a cross-platform feeling if your are working on a Linux or OSX machine. </p>

<pre><code>docker run -it windowsservercore cmd  
</code></pre>

<p>After the Docker container has started your OSX terminal turns into a Window command shell and you are in a cmd prompt running in a Windows Container in Azure:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/Bildschirmfoto-2016-02-01-um-08-44-29.png" alt="docker-run-cmd"></p>

<p>Let's look around inside that container. Go to <code>C:\</code> and check the files there. List all processes. You won't find much processes inside it as well as there is no Docker Engine inside. You really are working inside a Windows Container now.</p>

<p>Just type <code>exit</code> to stop the Windows Container again and you are back in your local terminal.</p>

<h2 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h2>

<p>All the normal Docker commands like <code>docker build</code> and <code>docker run</code> can be used from your local Notebook.</p>

<p>You also can use <code>docker search</code> and <code>docker pull</code> to pull some prebuilt Docker Images from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Now it is time to build the first Windows Docker images and run them later on. As an inspiration you can have a look at some Dockerfiles for Windows at one of these places</p>

But some of you had a closer look and were "disturbed" by the screenshot taken. It shows a Safari Browser on OSX. What? But you're talking about Windows.</p>

<p>That's because I'm on Mac since nearly two years, but I still have a strong connection to Windows and contribute some Chocolatey packages from time to time to make life easier working on Windows.</p>

<h2 id="macosx">Mac OSX</h2>

<p>Taking screenshots of a window on OSX works right out of the box. You just press <code>cmd ⌘</code> + <code>4</code> and then press <code>space</code> to select the current window and then press your touch pad to take the photo. And you will get a nice screenshot with a drop shadow. Done!</p>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>When it comes to take screenshots of let's say a Powershell terminal for one of my Windows 2016 TP4 blog posts I struggled with it.</p>

<p>Here is my recipe to minimize the effort taking nice screenshots of a window that is running in a Windows VM on my Mac.</p>

<p>That PowerShell terminal looks interesting. So how to extract it from the whole desktop?</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/desktop.png" alt="desktop"></p>

<p>First open <strong>Notepad</strong> from the start menu</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/open-notepad.png" alt="open-notepad"></p>

<p>Then maximize the Notepad window to have a big white background. PS: I also searched for a white web page in the internet, but always found "white" pages with lot's of ads on it. So Notepad is your tool here.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/maximize-notepad.png" alt="maximize-notepad"></p>

<p>Bring back your window up to the front and in place. There should be some white border around it. If your Windows has Aero or other effects you should already see some kind of shadow. Just take a photo and your're done. On Windows 10 / 2016 there is no effect, at least in my Vagrant boxes.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/bring-window-to-front.png" alt="bring-window-to-front"></p>

<p>As I'm working on a Mac, I now just use the OSX keyboard shortcut <code>cmd ⌘</code> + <code>4</code> and select a rectangle around the window, no matter how much of the white area I have selected.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/taking-raw-screenshot.png" alt="take-raw-screenshot"></p>

<p>The screenshot taken now has a lot of white border in it:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/raw-screenshot.png" alt="raw-screenshot"></p>

<p>On my Mac I have <strong>ImageMagick</strong> installed with <code>brew install imagemagick</code> and this little bash script <code>add-shadow</code> to do the trick: Trimming the white border and adding a drop shadow.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/run-add-shadow-script.png" alt="run-add-shadow-script"></p>

<p>The bash script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/add-shadow"><code>add-shadow</code></a> is more or less only a one-liner:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

convert "$1" -trim \( +clone -background grey25 -shadow 80x40+5+30 \) +swap -background transparent -layers merge +repage "$1-shadow.png"  
</code></pre>

<p>Run the script with the filename of the image you want to improve.</p>

<p>The new image now has a transparent drop shadow around the window without the white border. </p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/done.png" alt="done"></p>

<p>And this is the resulting Windows PowerShell terminal with the drop shadow in a blog post.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/raw-screenshot-png-shadow.png" alt="result"></p>

<p>This little script now saves me much time for upcoming blog posts. And I promise, I'll do some more Windows screenshots in the future...</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get started with Docker on Windows using Chocolatey]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The Docker tools are useful on a Windows machine to build and run applications in Linux containers locally in a VM or in the cloud.

With the Chocolatey package manager you can install all the Docker tools you need to get started.</p>

<p>If you don't know what a shell window is then you should have a look at the <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox"><strong>Docker Toolbox</strong></a> from Docker. But if you know and use a PowerShell or CMD shell window from time to time I'll guide you through the simple steps.</p>

<h2 id="letsgetchocolatey">Let's get Chocolatey</h2>

<p>Chocolatey is an open source project to provide a package manager for Windows as you might know it from Linux distro. You can install many of your software on your Windows machine with it.</p>

<p>Just open <a href="https://chocolatey.org">chocolatey.org</a> and search for eg. Chrome, Adobe Reader, or other tools you have installed manually in the past. You will find out fast that nearly everything could be installed with just the command</p>

<pre><code>choco install anything  
</code></pre>

<p>That makes Chocolatey really cool. It's like <code>apt-get</code>, but for Windows. And the software is downloaded from the original places, the choco packages only contains the instructions where to download it and how to install it silent.</p>

<p>If you haven't installed Chocolatey already just open the homepage <a href="https://chocolatey.org">https://chocolatey.org</a> and copy the simple command to your shell.</p>

<h2 id="dockerchocolateypackages">Docker Chocolatey packages</h2>

<p>To see which Docker tools are available through Chocolatey packages, just open the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=docker">Chocolatey homepage and search for docker</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/01/Bildschirmfoto-2016-01-16-um-23-12-12.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The Chocolatey packages for the Docker tools are maintained by the community. But they are kept up-to-date, so you can update each tool soon after the official release.</p>

<p>At the moment you can install</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker Client</li>
<li>Docker Machine</li>
<li>Docker Compose</li>
</ul>

<p>as well as a Docker Machine driver plugin for VMware Workstation.</p>

<h2 id="dockerclient">Docker Client</h2>

<p>To begin with Docker you need the Docker Client. Install it in a PowerShell or CMD shell window with</p>

<pre><code>choco install -y docker  
</code></pre>

<p>The option <code>-y</code> just auto-answers the question to run the install script.</p>

<p>Now we have the <code>docker</code> command installed. Try it out with <code>docker --version</code> for the installed version or <code>docker --help</code> to see the usage. This client will be used to build and run Docker Containers.</p>

<h2 id="dockermachine">Docker Machine</h2>

<p>The next step is to create a VM to run the Linux containers in it. <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/">Docker Machine</a> is the right tool for that task. So we first install it with</p>

<pre><code>choco install -y docker-machine  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="localhypervisor">Local Hypervisor</h2>

<p>Windows users can select between these three local hypervisors to run a Linux Docker Engine in it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyper-V</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>VMware Workstation</li>
</ul>

<p>All three hypervisors can be controlled by Docker Machine.</p>

<p>For Hyper-V follow the official guide how to install it on your machine.</p>

<p>VirtualBox can also be installed with Chocolatey, guess how</p>

<pre><code>choco install virtualbox  
</code></pre>

<p>For VMware Workstation you also need the driver plugin and VMware Workstation if not already installed:</p>

<pre><code>choco install docker-machine-vmwareworkstation  
choco install vmwareworkstation  
</code></pre>

<p>For VMware Workstation you enter your license before using it.</p>

<h2 id="cloud">Cloud</h2>

<p>You also can create a VM in the cloud, Docker Machine has a lot of cloud drivers built in. </p>

<ul>
<li>Windows Azure</li>
<li>Digital Ocean</li>
<li>Google GCE</li>
<li>OpenStack</li>
<li>Rackspace</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>See the official guide <a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started-cloud/">Using Docker Machine with a cloud provider</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="createadockermachine">Create a Docker Machine</h2>

<p>After you have set up your local hypervisor or chosen the cloud provider you want to use, create a Docker Machine VM with the name <code>dev</code> with one of these commands:</p>

<pre><code>docker-machine create -d hyperv dev  
docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev  
docker-machine create -d vmwareworkstation dev  
docker-machine create -d azure ... dev  
docker-machine create -d digitalocean ... dev  
</code></pre>

<p>There are driver specific options to tweak the VM settings or the token to connect to your account in the cloud.</p>

<p>After a while you will have your local or remote Docker Machine up and running.</p>

<p>You can check the status of the machine(s) with</p>

<pre><code>docker-machine ls  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="connecttoyourdockermachine">Connect to your Docker Machine</h2>

<p>For the Docker Client you need some environment variables so that the Docker Client knows how to connect to your local or remote Docker Engine.</p>

<p>In PowerShell it is really easy to set these environments.</p>

<pre><code>docker-machine env --shell powershell dev | iex  
</code></pre>

<p>In the near future can skip the <code>--shell</code> parameter as well to simplify this step.</p>

<p>After that you can control the Docker engine and start your first container, eg. this interactive shell</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash  
</code></pre>

<p>Type <code>exit</code> to terminate the container. <br>
Congratulations! You have started your first container.</p>

<h2 id="dockercompose">Docker Compose</h2>

<p>If you want to start more than one container that should work together you can use Docker Compose. It simplifies this task to setup a multi container application.</p>

<pre><code>choco install -y docker-compose  
</code></pre>

<p>Please refer to the official <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Overview of Docker Compose</a> guide to find out more.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to work from your Windows machine and control the world of Linux containers. In the near future you also can do this with Windows containers as well.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL/DR</h2>

<p>With just a few commands you get all the Docker tools installed on your Windows machine. And it fits into a single tweet:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/docker">@Docker</a> tools for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Windows?src=hash">#Windows</a>:&#10; &#10;choco install docker&#10;choco install docker-machine&#10;choco install docker-compose&#10;&#10;Done!</p>&mdash; Stefan Scherer (@stefscherer) <a href="https://twitter.com/stefscherer/status/662634469673799680">6.

<p><a href="https://www.scaleway.com">Scaleway</a> provides real ARM hardware in the cloud and Docker runs well on it. So here are the steps to spin up an own openVPN ARM Docker container at minimal costs.</p>

<h2 id="installlocaltools">Install local tools</h2>

<p>First install the scaleway commandline tool as well as the VPN client for Mac OSX.</p>

<pre><code>brew install scw  
brew cask install tunnelblick  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="prepareascalewayserver">Prepare a Scaleway server</h2>

<p>If you haven't one yet, create a Scaleway server running with Docker. The commandline tool makes this is really easy.</p>

<pre><code>scw login  
scw create --name scwdocker Docker_1_7_1  
scw start scwdocker  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="prepareandstartyouropenvpncontainer">Prepare and start your openVPN container</h2>

<p>The next steps should be done on the Scaleway server, so login to it with</p>

<pre><code>scw exec scwdocker bash  
</code></pre>

<p>There already is an ARM port of the <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockvpn">jpetazzo/dockvpn</a> Docker image for the Raspberry Pi. We just clone the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/dimetron/dockvpn-rpi">dimetron/dockvpn-rpi</a> and build the Docker image.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dimetron/dockvpn-rpi.git  
cd dockvpn-rpi  
docker build -t jpetazzo/dockvpn .  
docker run -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name=dockvpn -p 1194:1194/udp -p 443:443/tcp jpetazzo/dockvpn  
</code></pre>

<p>Now create the ovpn file by running another container and extract it with <code>curl</code>.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm -t -i -p 8080:8080 --volumes-from dockvpn jpetazzo/dockvpn serveconfig  
curl -k -v https://localhost:8080 &gt;scwvpn.ovpn  
</code></pre>

<p>You now may logout from your Scaleway server.</p>

<h2 id="backtomac">Back to Mac</h2>

<p>Copy the ovpn file back to your Mac with</p>

<pre><code>scw cp scwdocker:dockvpn-rpi/scwvpn.ovpn scwvpn.ovpn  
</code></pre>

<p>If the <code>scw cp</code> command hangs, try this command instead</p>

<pre><code>scw exec scwdocker cat dockvpn-rpi/scwvpn.ovpn &gt;scwvpn.ovpn  
</code></pre>

<p>Then double click on the ovpn file or open it with</p>

<pre><code>open scwvpn.ovpn  
</code></pre>

<p>and Tunnelblick should start and import the file. Now you're ready to connect to your VPN server running at Scaleway!</p>

<p>Please read the <a href="https://github.com/jpetazzo/dockvpn#security-discussion">security discussion</a> section and decide if you are happy with it.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kitematic meets Windows Docker]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I just want to share some screenshots with you.

<p>So everybody who is interested in Docker on Windows is now able to get a first impression of the current work. You either need a VM running in Azure with Windows 2016 TP3 or you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview">try Windows 2016 TP3</a> locally in a VM.</p>

<h2 id="setupdockeronwindows">Setup Docker on Windows</h2>

<p>In the case you only have a vanilla Window 2016 TP3 machine without Docker installed, you can follow this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/inplace_setup">Quick start guide</a>. Open a Powershell as an administrator and run these commands:</p>

<pre><code>wget -uri http://aka.ms/setupcontainers -OutFile C:\ContainerSetup.ps1  
C:\ContainerSetup.ps1  
</code></pre>

<p>This script will download and install the Docker daemon and a base image. Now the Docker daemon should be up and running as well as a first Docker base image <code>windowsservercore</code>. You can check that you are working with a Windows Docker daemon with the command <code>docker version</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/08/docker-version-png-shadow.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="thefirstownwindowsdockerimage">The first own Windows Docker image</h2>

<p>As a first example I want to show how to create a Node.js Docker image for Windows. I started with the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/docker-iojs/blob/662d803695a66cc3f01687bdca93ef23f416d030/3.1/Dockerfile">official iojs Dockerfile</a> and ported that to Windows commands. There are three steps to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>download the Node.js package</li>
<li>install the package</li>
<li>use the interpreter as the CMD</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/a99efe07160bd7f5ba62dcefa55e3c64a1bb2dcd/iojs/3.2/Dockerfile">my Windows version</a> of the <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code>FROM windowsservercore

ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL info  
ENV IOJS_VERSION 3.2.0

RUN powershell -Command "wget -Uri https://iojs.org/dist/v%IOJS_VERSION%/iojs-v%IOJS_VERSION%-x64.msi -OutFile iojs.msi -UseBasicParsing"

RUN msiexec.exe /q /i iojs.msi

CMD [ "iojs" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>To try it yourself, open up an editor and put these lines into a file <code>Dockerfile</code> and save it. Then build the Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t iojs .  
docker tag iojs:latest iojs:3.2.0  
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have your own iojs Docker image for Windows. The second command also tags the <code>iojs:latest</code> with the version number of io.js. You can check your available images with</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p>You can check the Docker image by running the installed Node.js runtime and retrieve the iojs version</p>

<pre><code>PS C:\Users\vagrant&gt; docker run -it iojs iojs --version  
v3.2.0  
</code></pre>

<p>OK, we now have the latest io.js running in a Windows Docker container.</p>

<h2 id="createaniojsonbuilddockerimage">Create an iojs:onbuild Docker image</h2>

<p>The official iojs Docker image has a nice second Dockerfile that uses the <code>ONBUILD</code> keyword. This Dockerfile can be used to add your Node.js application into a new Docker image very easily. You do not need to have Node.js installed on your host.</p>

<p>Again I started with the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/docker-iojs/blob/662d803695a66cc3f01687bdca93ef23f416d030/3.1/onbuild/Dockerfile">official iojs:onbuild Dockerfile</a> and ported it to Windows.</p>

<p>This is the Linux version of the Dockerfile:</p>

<pre><code>FROM iojs:3.1.0

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app  
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

ONBUILD COPY package.json /usr/src/app/  
ONBUILD RUN npm install  
ONBUILD COPY . /usr/src/app

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>It uses <code>WORKDIR</code> to set the current directory for all further commands. On Windows this and the <code>COPY</code> commands seems to be a work in progress. The current behavior is slightly different to Linux containers, but I found a workaround.</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/a99efe07160bd7f5ba62dcefa55e3c64a1bb2dcd/iojs/3.2/onbuild/Dockerfile">my current Windows version</a> of the onbuild Dockerfile that works with the current version of the Windows docker daemon.</p>

<pre><code>FROM iojs:3.2.0

RUN mkdir \app  
WORKDIR /app

ONBUILD COPY package.json package.json  
ONBUILD RUN npm install  
ONBUILD COPY . .

CMD [ "npm.cmd", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Now create the Docker image for this Dockerfile with this command:</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t iojs:onbuild .

<h2 id="putyournodejsappintoacontainer">Put your Node.js app into a Container</h2>

<p>Now we create a simple Node.js application and create a Windows Docker image with it. We now create three files</p>

<ul>
<li>package.json - with the start command and optional dependencies</li>
<li>index.js - with the application source code</li>
<li>Dockerfile - to build the Docker image </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="packagejson">package.json</h3>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "name": "hello-node",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "Hello world from io.js in a Windows docker container",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp; exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stefan Scherer",
  "license": "MIT"
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="indexjs">index.js</h3>

<p>As a simple example we just print a message, wait five seconds and print another message and exit the Node.js application.</p>

<pre><code>'use strict';

const os = require('os');

console.log('Hello World from', os.hostname());

setTimeout(function () {  
  console.log('Bye bye!');
}, 5*1000);
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for this example is quite simple. It just uses the Windows version of the <code>iojs:onbuild</code> Docker image:</p>

<pre><code>FROM iojs:onbuild  
</code></pre>

<p>All further steps to add the Node.js code and run <code>npm install</code> is already in this Docker image. We now install the Node.js application and create a new Container image with name <code>hello-node</code>.</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t hello-node .  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/08/docker-build-png-shadow.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now run the application with</p>

<pre><code>docker run -t hello-node  
</code></pre>

<p>You also can run the container in detached mode with</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name=hello -d hello-node  
</code></pre>

<p>and check the output while running the container or afterwards with</p>

<pre><code>docker logs hello  
</code></pre>

<p>So as you can see it is amazing what is already possible with Docker on Windows. I hope you enjoyed this blog post. Please feel free to add comments below and share this post if you like.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The technical preview gives us the possibility to get in touch with Docker for Windows for the first time. There may be some rough edges here and there, but I think there will be a fast progress to run Docker on Windows as smooth as with Linux containers.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Git push to build Vagrant Boxes with Atlas]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Today I have tested the new available service <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com">Atlas</a> to build Vagrant Boxes with Packer in the Cloud.</p>

<p>As the time of writing there is no direct GitHub integration for Atlas. So I just added another CI server as a glue between GitHub and Atlas to make it work. For this example I used <a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a>. And I love to receive Slack notifications of this build pipeline.</p>

<p>This is my current workflow</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/github_packer_circleci_atlas_slack.png" alt="packer-atlas-workflow"></p>

<h2 id="githubrepo">GitHub repo</h2>

<p>For this blog post I have created an <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-atlas-example">example repo</a> with an Ubuntu 14.04 packer template from the <a href="https://github.com/boxcutter">boxcutter Team</a>.</p>

<h2 id="atlas">Atlas</h2>

<p>Sign up at Atlas and create a Token for CircleCI</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/Bildschirmfoto-2015-07-09-um-23-02-49.png" alt="atlas-create-token"></p>

<h2 id="circleci">CircleCI</h2>

<p>Sign up at CircleCI and add the GitHub project with your packer template as a build project.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/Bildschirmfoto-2015-07-09-um-23-03-51.png" alt="circle-build-project"></p>

<p>Now go to the project settings and add an environment variable <code>ATLAS_TOKEN</code> with the Token that we have generated in Atlas.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/Bildschirmfoto-2015-07-09-um-23-04-45.png" alt="circle-add-atlas-token"></p>

<p>Now the connection between GitHub and CircleCI and Atlas is established.</p>

<h2 id="gitpush">git push</h2>

<p>After each <code>git push</code> CircleCI builds the project. It downloads and installs Packer 0.8.1 and starts <code>packer push</code></p>

<p>This is the <code>circle.yml</code> used in this example.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">machine:  
  timezone: Europe/Berlin

  environment:
    PACKER_VERSION: 0.8.1

dependencies:  
  pre:
    - &gt;
      sudo apt-get install -qq wget unzip &amp;&amp;
      sudo mkdir /opt/packer &amp;&amp;
      pushd /opt/packer &amp;&amp;
      echo "Downloading packer ${PACKER_VERSION}..." &amp;&amp;
      sudo wget --no-verbose https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/packer/packer_${PACKER_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip &amp;&amp;
      echo "Installing packer ${PACKER_VERSION}..." &amp;&amp;
      sudo unzip packer_${PACKER_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip &amp;&amp;
      sudo rm packer_${PACKER_VERSION}_linux_amd64.zip &amp;&amp;
      pushd /usr/bin &amp;&amp;
      sudo ln -s /opt/packer/* .

deployment:  
  publish:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - packer push -name=StefanScherer/packer-atlas-example packer-atlas-example.json
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/Bildschirmfoto-2015-07-09-um-23-11-10.png" alt="git-push"></p>

<p>This will just upload the packer template and files into Atlas. In Atlas the main work begins. A parallel build of the Vagrant Box for VMware and VirtualBox is started.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2015/07/Bildschirmfoto-2015-07-09-um-23-11-45.png" alt="atlas-packer-build"></p>

<p>The deployment to Atlas is configured in the Packer template in the post-processor section.</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">  "post-processors": [
    [
      {
        "type": "vagrant",
        "keep_input_artifact": false
      },
      {
        "type": "atlas",
        "only": ["vmware-iso"],
        "artifact": "StefanScherer/packer-atlas-example",
        "artifact_type": "vagrant.box",
        "metadata": {
          "provider": "vmware_desktop",
          "version": "{{ user `version` }}",
          "created_at": "{{timestamp}}"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "atlas",
        "only": ["virtualbox-iso"],
        "artifact": "StefanScherer/packer-atlas-example",
        "artifact_type": "vagrant.box",
        "metadata": {
          "provider": "virtualbox",
          "version": "{{ user `version` }}",
          "created_at": "{{timestamp}}"
        }
      }
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>After a while the Vagrant Boxes are deployed to Atlas and are available for your <code>Vagrantfile</code>.</p>

<h2 id="vagrantup">Vagrant up</h2>

<p>You now can use the new Vagrant Box with</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">vagrant init StefanScherer/packer-atlas-example  
vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to Hashicorp for that great service!</p>
