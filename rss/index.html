If you are using one of the following programming languages you can benefit of already available official Docker images for Windows.</p>

<p>These Docker images are well maintained and you can just start and put your application code inside and run your application easily in a Windows container.</p>

<p>Someone else did the hard work how to install the runtime or compiler for language XYZ into Windows Server Core container or even a Nanoserver container.</p>

<h2 id="prefernanoserver">Prefer NanoServer</h2>

<p>So starting to work with NanoServer is really easy with Docker as you only choose the right image for the <code>FROM</code> instruction in your <code>Dockerfile</code>. You can start with windowsservercore images, but I encourage you to test with nanoserver as well. For these languages it is easy to switch and the final Docker images are much smaller.</p>

<p>So let's have a look which languages are already available. The corresponding Docker Hub page normally has a short intro how to use these Docker images.</p>

<h2 id="go">Go</h2>

<p>The Go programming language is available on the Docker Hub as image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/"><code>golang</code></a>. To get the latest Go 1.8 for either Windows Server Core or NanoServer you choose one of these.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM golang:windowsservercore</code></li>
<li><code>FROM golang:nanoserver</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/">tags page</a> if you want another version or if you want to pin a specific version of Golang.</p>

<h2 id="java">Java</h2>

<p>When you hear Java you might immediately think of Oracle Java. But searching for alternatives I found three OpenJDK distros for Windows. One of them recently made it into the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/"><code>openjdk</code></a> Docker images. Both Windows Server Core and NanoServer are supported.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM openjdk:windowsservercore</code></li>
<li><code>FROM openjdk:nanoserver</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer Oracle Java for private installations, you can build a Docker image with the Dockerfiles provided in the <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleJava/windows-java-8">oracle/docker-images</a> repository.</p>

<h2 id="nodejs">Node.JS</h2>

<p>For Node.js there are pull requests awaiting a CI build agent for Windows to make it into the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/node/"><code>node</code></a> images.</p>

<p>In the meantime you can use one of my maintained images, for example the latest Node LTS version for both Windows Server Core and NanoServer:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM stefanscherer/node-windows:6</code></li>
<li><code>FROM stefanscherer/node-windows:6-nano</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You also can find more tags and versions at the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/node-windows/">Docker Hub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="python">Python</h2>

<p>The script language Python is available as Windows Server Core Docker image at the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/python/"><code>python</code></a> images. Both major versions of Python are available.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM python:3-windowsservercore</code></li>
<li><code>FROM python:2-windowsservercore</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a Python Docker image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/python-windows/">for NanoServer</a> with Python 3.6 to create smaller Docker images.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM stefanscherer/python-windows:nano</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="netcore">.NET Core</h2>

<p>Microsoft provides Linux and Windows Docker images for .NET Core at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/"><code>microsoft/dotnet</code></a>. For Windows it is NanoServer only, but this is no disadvantage as you should plan for the smaller NanoServer images.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM microsoft/dotnet:nanoserver</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aspnet">ASP.NET</h2>

<p>For ASP.NET there is a Windows Server Core Docker image with IIS installed at <a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/is-there-a-windows-docker-image-for/windowsservercore"><code>microsoft/aspnet</code></a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>FROM microsoft/aspnet:windowsservercore</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The number of programming languages provided in Windows Docker images is growing. This makes it relatively easy to port Linux applications to Windows or use Docker images to distribute apps for both platforms.</p>

<p>Haven't found an image for your language? Have I missed something? Please let me know, and use the comments below if you have questions how to get started. Thanks for your interest.

<h2 id="butimonwindows">But I'm on Windows</h2>

<p>To build applications for Windows there is a similar cloud based CI service, called <a href="https://www.appveyor.com">AppVeyor</a>.</p>

<p>And it works pretty similar to the other well known services for Linux: </p>

<ol>
<li>Put a YAML file into your repo with the build, test and deploy steps  </li>
<li>Connect your repo to the cloud CI service  </li>
<li>From now on a <code>git push</code> will do a lot for you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your CI pipeline is set up in a few clicks.</p>

<h2 id="appveyoryml">appveyor.yml</h2>

<p>Here is an example how such a YAML file looks like for AppVeyor. This is from a <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/win-getaddrinfo">small C/C++ project</a> I made long time ago during holiday without Visual Studio at hand. I just created that GitHub repo, added the <code>appveyor.yml</code> and voila - I got a compiled and statically linked <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/win-getaddrinfo/releases">Windows binary at GitHub releases</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">version: 1.0.{build}  
configuration: Release  
platform: x64  
build:  
  project: myfavoriteproject.sln
  verbosity: minimal
test: off  
artifacts:  
- path: x64/Release/myfavoriteproject.exe
  name: Release
deploy:  
- provider: GitHub
  auth_token:
    secure: xxxxx
</code></pre>

<p>The build worker in AppVeyor is fully armed with <a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/installed-software/">lots of development tools</a>, so you can build projects for serveral languages like Node.js, .NET, Ruby, Python, Java ...</p>

<h2 id="dockerbuild">Docker build</h2>

<p>AppVeyor now has released a new build worker with Windows Server 2016 and Docker 1.13.1 CS pre-installed. That instantly enables you to build, test and publish Windows Docker images in the same lightweight way.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/github_appveyor_docker.png" alt="Docker build with AppVeyor"></p>

<p>All you have to do is to select the new build worker by adding <code>image: Windows Server 2016</code> to your <code>appveyor.yml</code>. No more work to do to get a fully Windows Docker engine for your build.</p>

<p>The following <code>appveyor.yml</code> gives you an idea how easy an automated Docker build for Windows can be:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">version: 1.0.{build}  
image: Windows Server 2016

environment:  
  DOCKER_USER:
    secure: xxxxxxx
  DOCKER_PASS:
    secure: yyyyyyy
install:  
  - docker version

build_script:  
  - docker build -t me/myfavoriteapp .

test_script:  
  - docker run me/myfavoriteapp

deploy_script:  
  - docker login -u="$env:DOCKER_USER" -p="$env:DOCKER_PASS"
  - docker push me/myfavoriteapp
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very simple example. For the tests you can think of some more sophisticated tests like using Pester, Serverspec or Cucumber. For the deploy steps you can decide when to run these, eg. only for a tagged build to push a new release.</p>

<h2 id="addprojecttobuild">Add project to build</h2>

<p>Adding AppVeyor to one of your GitHub repos is very simple. Sign in to AppVeyor with your GitHub account and select your project to add.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/appveyor-add-project.png" alt="AppVeyor add project"></p>

<p>Now you can also check the pull requests you or others create on GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/github-pr-green.png" alt="GitHub pull request checks green"></p>

<p>You can click on the green checkmark to view the console output of the build.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/appveyor-build-green.png" alt="AppVeyor pull request build green"></p>

<h2 id="tellmeasecret">Tell me a secret</h2>

<p>To push to the Docker Hub we need to configure some secrets in AppVeyor. After you are logged in to AppVeyor you can select the "Encrypt data" menu item from the drop down menu or use the link <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt">https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt</a></p>

<p>There you can enter your cleartext secret and it creates the encrypted configuration data you can use in your <code>appveyor.yml</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/appveyor-encrypt-data.png" alt="Appveyor encrypt configuration data"></p>

<p>These secret variables don't get injected in pull request builds, so nobody can fork your repo and send you an <code>ls env:</code> pull request to expose that variables in the output.</p>

<h2 id="immutablebuilds">Immutable builds</h2>

<p>One of the biggest advantages over self-hosting a CI pipeline is that you get immutable builds. You just do not have to care about the dirt and dust your build left on the build worker. AppVeyor - like all other cloud based CI systems - just throws away the build worker and you get another empty one for the next build.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/appveyor-docker-build.png" alt="AppVeyor immutable build"></p>

<p>Even if you build Windows Docker images you don't have to cleanup your Docker host. You can concentrate on your code, the build and your tests, and forget about maintain your CI workers.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>I have some GitHub repos that already use AppVeyor to build Windows Docker images, so you can have a look how my setup works:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/winspector">github.com/StefanScherer/winspector</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>AppVeyor is my #1 when it comes to automated Windows builds. With the Docker support built-in it becomes even more interesting.</p>

A long awaited feature to use Docker Swarm on Windows, so it's time to test-drive it.</p>

<p>Well you wonder why this feature is available on Windows 10 and not Windows Server 2016. Sure it will make more sense in production running a Docker Swarm on multiple servers. The reason is that the Insider preview is the fastest channel to ship new features. Unfortunately there is no equivalent for Windows Server editions.</p>

<p>So if you need it for Windows Server you have to wait a little longer. You can indeed test Swarm-Mode on Windows Server 2016 and Docker 1.13, but only without the Overlay network.  To test Swarm-Mode with Overlay network you will need some machines running Windows 10 Insider 15031.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>In my case I use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to spin up Windows VM's locally on my notebook. The advantage is that you can describe some test scenarios with a <code>Vagrantfile</code> and share it on GitHub.</p>

<p>I already have played with Docker Swarm-Mode in December and created a <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box/tree/master/swarm-mode">Vagrant environment with some Windows Server 2016 VM's</a>. I'll re-use this scenario and just replace the underlying Vagrant box.</p>

<p>So the hardest part is to build a Windows 10 Insider 15031 VM. The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced">latest ISO file</a> with Windows 10 Insider 15025 is a good starting point. You have to switch to the Fast Ring to fetch the latest updates for Insider 15031.</p>

<p>Normally I use <a href="https://www.packer.io">Packer</a> with my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows">packer-windows</a> templates available on GitHub to automatically create such Vagrant boxes. In this case I only have a semi-automated template. Download the ISO file, build a VM with the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/windows_10_insider.json"><code>windows_10_insider.json</code></a> template and update it to Insider 15031 manually. With such a VM, build the final Vagrant box with the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/windows_10_docker.json"><code>windows_10_docker.json</code></a> Packer template.</p>

<p>What we now have is a Windows 10 Insider 15031 VM with the Containers and Hyper-V features activated, Docker 1.13.1 installed and both Microsoft Docker images downloaded. All the time consuming things should be done in a Packer build to make the final <code>vagrant up</code> a breeze.</p>

<p>In my case I had to add the Vagrant box with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_10_docker ./windows_10_insider_15031_docker_vmware.box  
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant 1.9.1 is able to use linked clones for VMware Fusion, VirtualBox and Hyper-V. So you need this big Vagrant box only once on disk. For the Docker Swarm only a clone will be started for each VM to save time and disk space.</p>

<h2 id="createtheswarm">Create the Swarm</h2>

<p>Now we use the prepared Vagrant environment and adjust it  </p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box  
cd docker-windows-box/swarm-mode  
vi Vagrantfile  
</code></pre>

<p>In the <code>Vagrantfile</code> I had to change only the name of the box after <code>config.vm.box</code> to the newly added Vagrant box. This is like changing the <code>FROM</code> in a <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/git-diff-swarm-mode.png" alt="git diff Vagrantfile"></p>

<p>I also adjusted the memory a little bit to spin up more Hyper-V containers.</p>

<p>But now we are ready to create the Docker Swarm with a simple</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>This will spin up three Windows 10 VM's and build the Docker Swarm automatically for you. But using linked clones and the well prepared Vagrant basebox it takes only some minutes to have a complete Docker Swarm up and running.</p>

<h2 id="dockernodels">docker node ls</h2>

<p>After all three VM's are up and running, go into the first VM and open a PowerShell terminal. With</p>

<pre><code>docker node ls  
</code></pre>

<p>you can check if your Docker Swarm is active.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/swarm-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="createanetwork">Create a network</h2>

<p>Now we create a new overlay network with</p>

<pre><code>docker network create --driver=overlay sample  
</code></pre>

<p>You can list all networks with <code>docker network ls</code> as there are already some others.</p>

<h2 id="createawhoamiservice">Create a whoami service</h2>

<p>With this new overlay network we start a simple service. I've prepared a Windows version of the <code>whoami</code> service. This is a simple webserver that just responds with its internal container hostname.</p>

<pre><code>docker service create --name=whoami --endpoint-mode dnsrr `  
  --network=sample stefanscherer/whoami-windows:latest
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment only DNS round robin is implemented as described in the Microsoft blog post. You cannot use to publish ports externally right now. More to come in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="runvisualizer">Run visualizer</h2>

<p>To make it more visible what happens in the next steps I recommend to run the Visualizer. On the first VM you can run the Visualizer with <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box/blob/master/swarm-mode/scripts/run-portainer.ps1">this script</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">C:\vagrant\scripts\run-visualizer.ps1  
</code></pre>

<p>Now open a browser with another <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box/blob/master/swarm-mode/scripts/open-visualizer.ps1">helper script</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">C:\vagrant\scripts\open-visualizer.ps1  
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can scale up the service to spread it over your Docker swarm.</p>

<pre><code>docker service scale whoami=4  
</code></pre>

<p>This will bring up the service on all three nodes and one of the nodes is running two instances of the whoami service.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/visualizer.png" alt="Visualizer"></p>

<p>Just play around scaling the service up and down a little bit.</p>

<h2 id="buildandcreateanotherservice">Build and create another service</h2>

<p>As I've mentioned above you cannot publish ports and there is no routing mesh at the moment. So the next thing is to create another service that will access the <code>whoami</code> service inside the overlay network. On Linux you probably would use <code>curl</code> to do that. I tried just a simple PowerShell script to do the same.</p>

<p>Two small files are needed to create a Docker image. First the simple script <code>askthem.ps1</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-powershell">while ($true) {  
  (Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing http://whoami:8000).Content
  Start-Sleep 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the PowerShell script will access the webserver with the hostname <code>whoami</code> on port 8000.</p>

<p>Now put this Script into a Docker image with this <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM microsoft/nanoserver  
COPY askthem.ps1 askthem.ps1  
CMD ["powershell", "-file", "askthem.ps1"]  
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t askthem .  
</code></pre>

<p>We now can start the second service that consumes the whoami service.</p>

<pre><code>docker service create --name=askthem --network=sample askthem:latest  
</code></pre>

<p>You now should see one instance of the newly created <code>askthem</code> service. Let's have a look at the logs. As this Vagrant environment enables the experimental features of Docker we are able to get the logs with this command:</p>

<pre><code>docker service logs askthem  
</code></pre>

<p>In my case I had luck and the <code>askthem</code> service got a response from one of the <code>whoami</code> containers that is running on a different Docker node.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/windows10-swarm-mode.png" alt="Windows 10 Swarm-Mode"></p>

<p>I haven't figured out why all the responses are from the same container. Maybe PowerShell or the <code>askthem</code> container itself caches the DNS requests. </p>

<p>But it still proves that overlay networking is working across multiple Windows machines.</p>

<h2 id="moretoplaywith">More to play with</h2>

<p>The Vagrant environment has some more things prepared. You also can spin up <a href="http://portainer.io">Portainer</a> that gives you a nice UI to your Docker swarm. You can have a look at your Nodes, the Docker images, the containers and services running and so on.</p>

<p>I also found out that you can scale services in the Portainer UI by changing the replicas. Running Visualizer and Portainer side-by-side demonstrates that:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/02/visualizer-portainer.gif" alt="Visualizer and Portainer"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think this setup can help you trying out the new Overlay network in Windows 10 Insider, and hopefully in Windows Server 2016 very soon as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker for Mac</li>
<li><code>git</code> (is already installed)</li>
<li><code>docker-compose</code> (already installed with D4M)</li>

<p>You can find my setup and all files in my GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/ghost-buster-docker">StefanScherer/ghost-buster-docker</a>.</p>

<p>As I'm upgrading from my local Ghost installation to this dockerized version I already have some content, the static files and my GitHub pages repo. Please refer to my old blog post how to create your repo. The following commands should give you an idea how to setup the two folders <code>content</code> and <code>static</code>.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/ghost-buster-docker  
cd ghost-buster-docker  
mkdir content  
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/YOURNAME.github.io static  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="dockercomposeyml">docker-compose.yml</h3>

<p>To simplify running Ghost and Buster I've created a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> with all the published ports and volume mount points.</p>

<p>There are three services</p>

<ul>
<li>ghost</li>
<li>buster</li>
<li>preview</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">version: '2.1'

services:  
  ghost:
    image: ghost:0.11.4
    volumes:
      - ./content:/var/lib/ghost
    ports:
      - 2368:2368

  buster:
    image: stefanscherer/buster
    command: /buster.sh
    volumes:
      - ./static:/static
      - ./buster.sh:/buster.sh

  preview:
    image: nginx
    volumes:
      - ./static:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro
    ports:
      - 2369:80
</code></pre>

<h3 id="editcontentwithghost">Edit content with Ghost</h3>

<p>To create new blog post or edit existing posts you spin up the <code>ghost</code> container with</p>

<pre><code>docker-compose up -d ghost  
</code></pre>

<p>and then open up your browser at <code>https://stefanscherer.github.io/ghost</code> to login and edit content. As you can see the folder <code>content</code> is mapped into the <code>ghost</code> container to persist your Ghost blog data and images on your host machine.</p>

<h3 id="generatestaticfiles">Generate static files</h3>

<p>To generate the static HTML pages we use the second service with Buster installed. This is no real service, so we do not "up" but "run" it with</p>

<pre><code>docker-compose run buster  
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have updated files in the <code>static</code> folder. You may edit the local script <code>buster.sh</code> to fix some links that Buster broke in the past in my pages.</p>

<h2 id="previewstaticfiles">Preview static files</h2>

<p>From time to time it is useful to check the generated static HTML files before pushing them to GitHub pages. The third service is useful to run a webserver with the created static pages.</p>

<pre><code>docker-compose up -d preview  
</code></pre>

<p>Open your browser at <code>http://localhost:2369</code> and check if everything looks good. In my setup I've added Disqus and first wanted to try out the results of modifying the <code>post.hbs</code> file of the theme.</p>

<h3 id="deploystaticfiles">Deploy static files</h3>

<p>If you are happy with the new static files it's time to push them. I've added a small script <code>deploy.sh</code> to do the final steps on the host as only <code>git</code> is used here. As I'm using GitHub with SSH and a passphrase I don't want to put that into a container. Have a look at the shell script and you will see that it's only a <code>git add &amp;&amp; git commit &amp;&amp; git push</code> script.</p>

<pre><code>./deploy.sh
</code></pre>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think this setup will help me in the future to update Ghost more easily. </p>

But how do you know if your underlying Docker image you use in the <code>FROM</code> line of your <code>Dockerfile</code> also uses the correct version of the Windows base image?</p>

<p>Is there a way to look into container images without downloading them?</p>

<p>There are several services like <a href="https://imagelayers.io">imagelayers.io</a>, <a href="https://microbadger.com">microbadger</a>, <a href="http://shields.io">shields.io</a> and others which provide badges and online views for existing Docker images at Docker Hub. Unfortunately not all support Windows images at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="enterwinspector">Enter winspector</h2>

<p>I found an <a href="https://github.com/giantswarm/inspect-docker-image">inspector tool</a> written in Python that might be useful for that task. I've enhanced it and created a tool called winspector which is available as Docker image <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/winspector/">stefanscherer/winspector</a> for Windows and Linux. With this tool you can inspect any Windows Docker images on the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>Winspector will show you</p>

<ul>
<li>The creation date of the image and the Docker version and Windows version used at build time.</li>
<li>The number of layers down to the Windows base image</li>
<li>Which <strong>Windows base image</strong> the given image depends on. So you know whether a random Windows image uses the up to date Windows base image or not.</li>
<li>The <strong>size of each layer</strong>. This is useful to when you try to optimize your image size.</li>
<li>The <strong>"application size" without the Windows base layers</strong>. So you get an idea how small your Windows application image really is and what other users have to download provided that they already have the base image.</li>
<li>The history of the image. It tries to <strong>reconstruct the <code>Dockerfile</code> commands</strong> that have been used to build the image.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="runitfromwindows">Run it from Windows</h3>

<p>If you have Docker running with Windows containers, use this command to run the tool with any given image name and an optional tag.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm stefanscherer/winspector microsoft/iis  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/01/winspector-wndows.png" alt="run from windows"></p>

<p>At the moment the Docker image depends on the windowsservercore base image. I'll try to move it to nanoserver to reduce download size for Windows 10 users.</p>

<h3 id="runitfrommaclinux">Run it from Mac / Linux</h3>

<p>If you have a Linux Docker engine running, just use the exact same command as on Windows. The Docker image <code>stefanscherer/winspector</code> is a <strong>multiarch Docker image</strong> and Docker will pull the correct OS specific image for you automatically.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm stefanscherer/winspector microsoft/iis  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/01/winspector-mac.png" alt="run from mac"></p>

<h2 id="inspectingsomeimages">Inspecting some images</h2>

<p>Now let's try winspector and inspect a random Docker image. We could start with the Windows base image itself.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run --rm stefanscherer/winspector microsoft/windowsservercore
</code></pre>

<p>Even for this image it can show you some details:</p>

<pre><code>Image name: microsoft/windowsservercore  
Tag: latest  
Number of layers: 2  
Sizes of layers:  
  sha256:3889bb8d808bbae6fa5a33e07... - 4069985900 byte
  sha256:3430754e4d171ead00cf67667... - 913145061 byte
Total size (including Windows base layers): 4983130961 byte  
Application size (w/o Windows base layers): 0 byte  
Windows base image used:  
  microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.447 full
  microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.693 update
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the latest windowsservercore image has two layers. The sizes shown here are the download sizes of the compressed layers. The smaller one is the layer that will be replaced by a newer update layer with the next release.</p>

<h2 id="howbigisthewinspectorimage">How big is the winspector image?</h2>

<p>Now let's have a look at the winspector Windows image to see what winspector can retrieve for you.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run --rm stefanscherer/winspector stefanscherer/winspector:windows-1.4.3
</code></pre>

<p>The (shortened) output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Image name: stefanscherer/winspector  
Tag: windows-1.4.3  
Number of layers: 14  
Schema version: 1  
Architecture: amd64  
Created: 2017-01-15 21:35:22 with Docker 1.13.0-rc7 on windows 10.0.14393.693  
Sizes of layers:  
  ...

Total size (including Windows base layers): 360497565 byte  
Application size (w/o Windows base layers): 27188879 byte  
Windows base image used:  
  microsoft/nanoserver:10.0.14393.447 full
  microsoft/nanoserver:10.0.14393.693 update
History:  
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>So the winspector Windows image is about 27 MByte and it uses the latest nanoserver base image.</p>

<h2 id="inspectinglinuximages">Inspecting Linux images</h2>

<p>And winspector is not restricted to Windows images, you can inspect Linux images as well.</p>

<p>If you run</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run --rm stefanscherer/winspector stefanscherer/winspector:linux-1.4.3
</code></pre>

<p>then winspector will show you</p>

<pre><code>Image name: stefanscherer/winspector  
Tag: linux-1.4.3  
Number of layers: 8  
Schema version: 1  
Architecture: amd64  
Created: 2017-01-15 21:34:21 with Docker 1.12.3 on linux  
Sizes of layers:  
  ...
Total size (including Windows base layers): 32708231 byte  
Application size (w/o Windows base layers): 32708231 byte  
Windows base image used:  
  It does not seem to be a Windows image
History:  
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see the Linux image is about 32 MByte.</p>

<p>So once you have downloaded the latest Windows base images like windowsservercore or nanoserver the download experience is the same for both platforms.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>With winspector you can check any Windows container image on the Docker Hub which version of Windows it uses.</p>

<p>You can also see how big each image layer is and learn how to optimize commands in your Dockerfile to create smaller Windows images.</p>

<p>The tool is open source on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/winspector">github.com/StefanScherer/winspector</a>. It is community driven, so feel free to send me feedback in form of issues or pull requests. </p>

If you have tried Windows Containers already and built some Windows Container images you may wonder how to implement an update strategy.</p>

<p>How can I install Windows Updates in my container image?</p>

<p>Working with containers is not the same as working with real servers or VM's you support for months or years. A container image is a static snapshot of the filesystem (and Windows registry and so on) at a given time.</p>

<p>You won't enter a running container and run the Windows Update there. But how should we do it then?</p>

<h2 id="containerimageshavelayers">Container images have layers</h2>

<p>First have a look how a container image looks like. It is not just a snapshot. A container image consist of multiple layers. When you look at your <code>Dockerfile</code> you normally use a line like <code>FROM microsoft/windowsservercore</code>.</p>

<p>Your container image then uses the Windows base image that contains a layer with all the files needed to run Windows containers.</p>

<p>If you have some higher level application you may use other prebuilt container images like <code>FROM microsoft/iis</code> or <code>FROM microsoft/aspnet</code>. These images also re-use the <code>FROM microsoft/windowsservercore</code> as base image.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/01/windows_image_layers-2.png" alt="Windows app image layers"></p>

<p>On top of that you build your own application image with your code and content needed to run the application in a self contained Windows container.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes your application image now uses several layers that will be downloaded from the Docker Hub or any other container registry. Same layers can be re-used for different other images. If you build multiple ASP.NET appliations as Docker images they will re-use the same layers below.</p>

<p>But now back to our first question: How to apply Windows Updates in a container image? </p>

<h2 id="thewindowsbaseimages">The Windows base images</h2>

<p>Let's have a closer look at the Windows base images. Microsoft provides two base images: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/">windowsservercore</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/nanoserver/">nanoserver</a>. Both base images are updated on a regular basis to roll out all security fixes and bug fixes. You might know that the base image for windowsservercore is about 4 to 5 GByte to download.</p>

<p>So do we have to download the whole base image each time for each update?</p>

<p>If we look closer how the base images are built we see that they contain two layers: One big base layer that will be used for a longer period of time. And there is a smaller update layer that contains only the patched and updated files for the new release.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/01/windowsservercore_updates.gif" alt="Windows Server Core updates"></p>

<p>So updating to a newer Windows base image version isn't painful as only the update layer must be pulled from the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>But in the long term it does not make sense to stick forever to the old base layer. Security scanners will mark them as vulnerable and also all the images that are built from them. And the update layer will increase in size for each new release. So from time to time there is a "breaking" change that replaces the base layer and a new base layer will be used for upcoming releases. We have seen that with the latest release in December.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2017/01/windowsservercore_updates_all.gif" alt="Windows Server Core major update"></p>

<p>From time to time you will have to download the big new base layer which is about 4 GByte for windowsservercore (and only about 240 MByte for nanoserver, so try to use nanoserver whereever you can) when you want to use the latest Windows image release.</p>

<h2 id="keeporupdate">Keep or update?</h2>

<p>Should I avoid updating the Windows image to revision 576 to keep my downloads small? <strong>No!</strong></p>

<p>My recommendation is to update all your Windows container images and rebuild them with the newest Windows image. You have to download that bigger base layer also <strong>only once</strong> and all your container images will re-use it.</p>

<p>Perhaps your application code also has some updates you want to ship. It's a good time to ship it on top of the newest Windows base image. So I recommend to run</p>

<pre><code>docker pull microsoft/windowsservercore  
docker pull microsoft/nanoserver  
</code></pre>

<p>before you build new Windows container images to have the latest OS base image with all security fixes and bug fixes in it.</p>

<p>If you want to keep track which version of the Windows image you use, you can use the tags provided for each release.</p>

<p>Instead of using only the latest version in your <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code>FROM microsoft/windowsservercore  
</code></pre>

<p>you can append the tag</p>

<pre><code>FROM microsoft/windowsservercore:10.0.14393.576  
</code></pre>

<p>But I still recommend to update the tag after a new Windows image has been published.</p>

<p>You can find the tags for <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/tags/">windowsservercore</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/nanoserver/tags/">nanoserver</a> on the Docker Hub.</p>

<h2 id="whatabouttheframeworkimages">What about the framework images?</h2>

<p>Typically you build your application on top of some kind of framework like <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnet/tags/">ASP.NET</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/tags/">IIS</a> or a runtime language like Node.js, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/library/python/">Python</a> and so on. You should have a look at the update cycles of these framework images. The maintainers have to rebuild the framework images after a new release of the Windows base image came out.</p>

<p>If you see some of your framework images lag behind, encourage the maintainer to update the Windows base image and to rebuild the framework image.</p>

<p>With such updated framework images - they hopefully come with a new version tag - you can rebuild your application.</p>

<h1 id="tldr">TL/DR</h1>

<p>So your part to get Windows Updates into your Windows Container images is to choose the newer image in your <code>Dockerfile</code> and rebuild your application image with it.</p>

<p>If you haven't used version tags of the image below, do a <code>docker pull ...</code> of that image to get sure to have the updated one before you rebuild.</p>

This is pretty easy as there is a prebuilt VM with the Docker base images. But I want a secured connection from my laptop to the Windows Docker engine running in Azure.</p>

<p>There is a tutorial <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/">Protect the Docker daemon socket</a> at the website of Docker which uses the <code>openssl</code> tool to create all the certificates etc. But how should we do this on Windows?</p>

<h2 id="justcontainerizewhatsthere">Just containerize what's there</h2>

<p>I have seen the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-server-container-tools/DockerTLS">DockerTLS</a> script in a GitHub repo from Microsoft. But this script installs OpenSSL on my machine which I don't want to.</p>

<p>My first thought was, let's put this script + OpenSSL into a Docker image and run it in a Windows container.</p>

<p>So this <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/2e2a5b12252816744f5414e0621e12bb74b6f59c/dockertls/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> was my first attempt to just use Chocolatey to install OpenSSL, download the PowerShell script from the Microsoft GitHub repo. Done. The script can run in a safe environment and I don't have to install software on my Docker host.</p>

<h2 id="dockertls">DockerTLS</h2>

<p>But there is still work to do on the host to configure the Docker engine which I wanted to automate a little more. So it would be great to have a tool that can</p>

<ul>
<li>generate all TLS certs</li>
<li>create or update the Docker <code>daemon.json</code> file</li>
<li>Put the client certs into my home directory</li>
</ul>

<p>But still we need a program or script with OpenSSL to do that. I thought this tool should be deployed in a Docker image and shared on the Docker Hub. And here it is:</p>

<h2 id="dockerrundockertls">docker run dockertls</h2>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/10/dockertls.png" alt="dockertls"></p>

<p>The script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/master/dockertls/generate-certs.ps1">generate-certs.ps1</a> creates the TLS certs and copies them to the folders that would be used on the Docker host. The script would directly work on a Docker host if you have OpenSSL/LibreSSL installed.</p>

<p>The dockertls Docker image is created with this <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/blob/master/dockertls/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a>. It installs LibreSSL from OpenBSD (thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/friism">Michael Friis</a> for that optimization) and copies the PowerShell script inside the image.</p>

<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/dockertls">full source code</a> of the dockertls image in my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">dockerfiles-windows</a> GitHub repo if you want to build the Docker image yourself.</p>

<p>Otherwise you can just the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/dockertls-windows/">dockertls Docker image</a> from the Docker Hub.</p>

<h3 id="dryrun">Dry run</h3>

<p>As you don't trust me or my Docker image you can do a dry run with some temporary folders where the container can copy files into without destroying your Docker host.</p>

<p>Just create two folders:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir server  
mkdir client\.docker  
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the Windows container with the environment variables <code>SERVER_NAME</code> and <code>IP_ADDRESSES</code> as well as two volume mounts to write the certs back to the host:</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm `  
  -e SERVER_NAME=$(hostname) `
  -e IP_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1,192.168.254.123 `
  -v "$(pwd)\server:C:\ProgramData\docker" `
  -v "$(pwd)\client\.docker:C:\Users\ContainerAdministrator\.docker" `
  stefanscherer/dockertls-windows
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards check the folders:</p>

<pre><code>dir server\certs.d  
dir server\config  
dir client\.docker  
</code></pre>

<p>You will see that there are three pem files for the server, the <code>daemon.json</code> file as well as three pem files for the client.</p>

<p>Of course you could manually copy the files and try them out. But this Docker image can do this for you as well.</p>

<h3 id="fullrun">Full run</h3>

<p>You may have to create the <code>.docker</code> folder in your home directory.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\.docker  
</code></pre>

<p>Now run the container with the correct paths on the host so it can copy all certs and configs to the right place. The script can read an existing <code>daemon.json</code> and update it to keep all other configuration untouched.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --rm `  
  -e SERVER_NAME=$(hostname) `
  -e IP_ADDRESSES=127.0.0.1,192.168.254.123 `
  -v "C:\ProgramData\docker:C:\ProgramData\docker" `
  -v "$env:USERPROFILE\.docker:C:\Users\ContainerAdministrator\.docker" `
  stefanscherer/dockertls-windows
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have to restart the Docker service in an administrator Shell with</p>

<pre><code>restart-service docker  
</code></pre>

<p>One last step is needed on your host. You have to open the port 2376 in your firewall so you can access the machine from the outside. But then you're done on your host.</p>

<p>You can recreate the TLS certs with the same command and just restart the Docker service afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="testtlsconnection">Test TLS connection</h3>

<p>Now test the connection to the TLS secured Docker service with</p>

<pre><code>docker --tlsverify `  
  --tlscacert=$env:USERPROFILE\.docker\ca.pem `
  --tlscert=$env:USERPROFILE\.docker\cert.pem `
  --tlskey=$env:USERPROFILE\.docker\key.pem `
  -H=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 version
</code></pre>

<p>Or just set some environment variables</p>

<pre><code>$env:DOCKER_HOST="tcp://127.0.0.1:2376"
$env:DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
docker version  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="azure">Azure</h3>

<p>In an Azure VM you should use your DNS name for the VM in the <code>SERVER_NAME</code> environment variable and your public and local IP addresses of that machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/10/dockertls-run---Kopie.png" alt="docker-run"></p>

<p>You have to open the firewall port 2376 on your Windows Docker host.</p>

<p>For Azure you also have to add a incoming rule for port 2376 in your network security group.</p>

<p>Then you have to securely transfer the three client pem files from your Azure VM to your laptop.</p>

<p>I've done that on my old Windows 10 machine which is only a 32bit machine, but I still can work with the Windows 2016 Docker engine running in Azure.</p>

With this you can work with Docker running <strong>Linux containers</strong> in a very easy way on Windows 10 Pro with Hyper-V installed. In the meantime there is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">stable version and a beta channel</a> to retrieve newer versions.</p>

<p>And Microsoft has added the <strong>Containers feature</strong> in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. With some <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start_windows_10">installation steps</a> you are able to run <strong>Windows Hyper-V Containers</strong> on your Windows 10 machine.</p>

<p>But there is a little bit of confusion which sort of containers can be started with each of the two installations. And you can't run both Docker Engines side-by-side without some adjustments.</p>

<p>This is because each of the installations use the same default named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine</code> causing one of the engines to fail to start.</p>

<h2 id="beta26torulethemall">Beta 26 to rule them all</h2>

<p>Beginning with the Docker for Windows Beta 26 there is a very easy approach to solve this confusion. You only have to install Docker for Windows with the MSI installer. There is a new menu item in the Docker tray icon to switch between Linux and Windows containers.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-for-windows-switch.gif" alt="switching"></p>

<p>As you can see in the video you don't have to change environment variables or use the <code>-H</code> option of the Docker client to talk to the other Docker engine.</p>

<p>So if you download <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/">Docker for Windows beta</a> or switch to the beta channel in your installation you can try this out yourself.</p>

<p>The installer will activate the <strong>Containers</strong> feature if you haven't done that yet. A reboot is required for this to add this feature.</p>

<p>From now on you can easily switch with the menu item in the tray icon.</p>

<p>There also is a command line tool to switch the engine. In a PowerShell windows you can type</p>

<pre><code>&amp; 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
</code></pre>

<p>and it switches from Linux to Windows or vice versa. Take care and type the option as shown here as the option is case sensitive.</p>

<h2 id="proxyfortherescue">Proxy for the rescue</h2>

<p>But how does the switching work without the need to use another named pipe or socket from the Docker client?</p>

<p>The answer is that there is running a Proxy process <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> which listens on the default named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine</code>.</p>

<p>If you switch from Linux to Windows the Windows Docker engine <code>dockerd.exe</code> will be started for you which is listening on another named pipe <code>//./pipe/docker_engine_windows</code> and a new started Proxy process redirects to this.</p>

<h3 id="underthehood">Under the hood</h3>

<p>I have installed the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/bb896645">Sysinternals Process Monitor</a> tool to learn what happens while switching from Linux to Windows containers. With the Process Tree function you can see a timeline with green bars when each process has started or exited.</p>

<p>The following screenshot shows the processes before and after the switch. I have switched about in the middle of the green bar.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/switch-to-windows-dockerd.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The current <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> (above <code>dockerd.exe</code> in the list) that talked to the MobyLinuxVM exits as the dark green bar highlights that.</p>

<p>The <code>dockerd.exe</code> Windows Docker engine is started, as well as a new <code>com.docker.proxy.exe</code> (below <code>dockerd.exe</code>) which talks to the Windows Docker engine.</p>

<p>So just after the switch you still can use the <code>docker.exe</code> Client or your Docker integration in your favorite editor or IDE without any environment changes.</p>

<h2 id="runningbothcontainerworldsinparallel">Running both container worlds in parallel</h2>

<p>The proxy process just switches the connection to the Docker engine. After such a switch both the Linux and Windows Docker engine are running.</p>

<h3 id="runalinuxwebserver">Run a Linux web server</h3>

<p>To try this out we first switch back to the Linux containers. Now we run the default nginx web server on port 80</p>

<pre><code>docker run -p 80:80 -d nginx  
</code></pre>

<p>then switch to the Windows containers with</p>

<pre><code>&amp; 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-run-nginx.png" alt="docker-run-nginx"></p>

<p>Now let's run some Windows containers. But first we try if the Linux container is still running and reachable with</p>

<pre><code>start http://localhost  
</code></pre>

<p>With the <code>start</code> command you open Edge with the welcome page of the nginx running in a Linux container</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/nginx.png" alt="nginx"></p>

<p>Yes, the Linux container is still running.</p>

<h2 id="buildawindowswebserver">Build a Windows web server</h2>

<p>On Windows 10 you <del>only can run Nanoserver containers. There is no IIS docker image for Nanoserver</del>. <strong>Ignite update</strong>: You can run Nanoserver <strong>AND</strong> windowsservercore containers on Windows 10.</p>

<p>But to demo how simple nanoserver containers could be I'll keep the following sample as it is. So we create our own small Node.js web server. First we write the simple web server app</p>

<pre><code>notepad app.js  
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this code as the mini web server in the file <code>app.js</code> and save the file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var http = require('http');  
var port = 81;

function handleRequest(req, res) {  
  res.end('Hello from Windows container, path = ' + req.url);
}

var server = http.createServer(handleRequest);

server.listen(port);  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we build a Windows Docker image with that application. We open another editor to create the <code>Dockerfile</code> with this command</p>

<pre><code>notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this as the <code>Dockerfile</code>. As you can see only the <code>FROM</code> line is different from a typical Linux Dockerfile. This one uses a Windows base image from the Docker Hub.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM stefanscherer/node-windows:6.7.0-nano

COPY app.js app.js

CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file and build the Docker image with the usual command</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t webserver .  
</code></pre>

<p>Run the Windows web server as a Docker container with</p>

<pre><code>docker run -p 81:81 -d webserver  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-run-webserver-1.png" alt="docker-run-webserver"></p>

<p>At the moment you can't connect directly with 127.0.0.1 to the container. But it is possible to use the IP address of the container. We need the ID or name of the container, so list the containers running with</p>

<pre><code>docker ps  
</code></pre>

<p>Then open the browser with the container's IP address:  </p>

<pre><code>start http://$(docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" grave_thompson):81  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/docker-inspect.png" alt="docker-inspect"></p>

<p>Additionally the port forwarding from the host to the container allows you to contact the web server on port 81 from another machine.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/09/curl-to-windows-10.png" alt="curl-to-windows-10"></p>

<p>And yes, the Windows container is also handling requests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The new Docker for Windows beta combines the two container worlds and simplifies building Docker images for both Linux and Windows, making a Windows 10 machine a good development platform for both.</p>

<p>And with a little awareness when to switch to the right Docker engine, both Linux and Windows containers can run side-by-side.</p>

Beside lots of new features in Docker 1.12 we heard about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7ABdUmen9s">Windows Server and Docker</a> and upcoming features in the Windows Docker engine. </p>

<p>Another highlight for me after the conference was a visit at the Microsoft Campus in Redmond to meet the Windows Container team around Taylor Brown. After a meeting and having lunch we talked about making my Packer template for a <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/windows_2016_docker.json">Windows Server 2016 TP5 Docker VM</a> work with Hyper-V. At that time my packer template supported only VirtualBox and VMware with a <a href="https://stefanscherer.github.io/setup-local-windows-2016-tp5-docker-vm/">blog post describing how to build it</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/20160623_101541.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So Patrick Lang from Microsoft and I started to have a look at the pull request <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/pull/2576">mitchellh/packer#2576</a> by Taliesin Sisson that adds a Hyper-V builder to Packer. After a couple of days (already back to Germany working in different time zones) we improved the template through <a href="https://github.com/PatrickLang/packer-windows/commit/7e13d4799e28a3afb1e35b878e00394256011022">GitHub</a> and finally got it working.</p>

<h2 id="packerbuildvagrantup">packer build, vagrant up</h2>

<p>If you haven't heard about <a href="https://www.packer.io">Packer</a> and <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> let me explain it with the following diagram. If you want to create a VM from an ISO file you normally click through your hypervisor UI and then follow the installation steps inside the VM.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/packer_vagrant.png" alt="packer build, vagrant up"></p>

<p>With Packer you can automate that step building a VM from an ISO file, put all steps into a Packer template and then just share the template so others can just run</p>

<pre><code>packer build template.json  
</code></pre>

<p>In our case the output is a Vagrant box. That is a compressed VM ready to be used with the next tool - Vagrant. It takes a Vagrant box, creates a copy of it to turn it on so you can work again and again with the same predefined VM that was built by Packer. You want to turn your VM on? Just type</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>You want to stop the VM after work? Just type</p>

<pre><code>vagrant halt  
</code></pre>

<p>You want to try something out and want to undo all that to start over with the clean state. Just destroy it and start it again.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant destroy  
vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>There are much more commands and even snapshots can be used. The advantage is that you don't have to know all the buttons in your hypervisor. Both Packer and Vagrant are available for <strong>Windows, Mac and Linux</strong> and also <strong>support <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PuppetLabs/multiprovider-vagrant">multiple hypervisors</a></strong> and even cloud providers.</p>

<p>So you only have to learn one or both of these tools and you're done if you have to work with VM's.</p>

<h2 id="addinghypervbuilder">Adding Hyper-V builder</h2>

<p>The Packer template for a VM has one or more builder sections. The Hyper-V section looks like this and contains the typical steps</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding files for a virtual floppy for the first boot</li>
<li>Defining disk size, memory and CPU's</li>
<li>How to login into the VM</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-json">    {
      "vm_name":"WindowsServer2016TP5Docker",
      "type": "hyperv-iso",
      "disk_size": 41440,
      "boot_wait": "0s",
      "headless": false,
      "guest_additions_mode":"disable",
      "iso_url": "{{user `iso_url`}}",
      "iso_checksum_type": "{{user `iso_checksum_type`}}",
      "iso_checksum": "{{user `iso_checksum`}}",
      "floppy_files": [
        "./answer_files/2016/Autounattend.xml",
        "./floppy/WindowsPowershell.lnk",
        "./floppy/PinTo10.exe",
        "./scripts/disable-winrm.ps1",
        "./scripts/docker/enable-winrm.ps1",
        "./scripts/microsoft-updates.bat",
        "./scripts/win-updates.ps1"
      ],
      "communicator":"winrm",
      "winrm_username": "vagrant",
      "winrm_password": "vagrant",
      "winrm_timeout" : "4h",
      "shutdown_command": "shutdown /s /t 10 /f /d p:4:1 /c \"Packer Shutdown\"",
      "ram_size_mb": 2048,
      "cpu": 2,
      "switch_name":"{{user `hyperv_switchname`}}",
      "enable_secure_boot":true
    },
</code></pre>

<p>Packer can also download ISO files from a download link to make automation very easy. </p>

<p>The installation of a Windows Server 2016 VM can be automated with an <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/answer_files/2016/Autounattend.xml"><code>Autounattend.xml</code></a> file. This file contains information to setup the Windows VM until the WinRM service is up and running and Packer can login from the host machine to run further provision scripts to setup the VM with additional installations.</p>

<p>In case of the Windows Server 2016 TP5 Docker VM we additionally <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/my/scripts/docker/install-docker.ps1">install Docker 1.12</a> and pull the Windows base OS docker images into the VM.</p>

<p>All these steps defined in the Packer template build a good Vagrant box to have Docker preinstalled with the base docker image as it takes some time to download it the first time.</p>

<p>So after a <code>vagrant destroy</code> you still have the Windows OS docker images installed and can work with a clean installation again. Only from time to time when there is a new OS docker image version you have to rebuild your Vagrant box with Packer.</p>

<h2 id="buildthehypervvagrantbox">Build the Hyper-V Vagrant box</h2>

<p>To build the Vagrant box locally on a Windows 10 machine you only need the <strong>Hyper-V feature</strong> activated and you need a <strong>special version of <code>packer.exe</code></strong> (notice: with <code>choco install packer</code> you only get the upstream packer where the hyperv builder is not integrated yet). The packer.exe with hyperv builder can be downloaded at <a href="https://dl.bintray.com/taliesins/Packer/">https://dl.bintray.com/taliesins/Packer/</a>.</p>

<p>Clone my packer template from GitHub and build it with these commands:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
packer build --only=hyperv-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>This will take some time downloading and caching the ISO file, booting, installing the software and pulling the first Docker images.</p>

<h2 id="sharevagrantboxeswithatlas">Share Vagrant boxes with Atlas</h2>

<p>Another advantage of Vagrant is that you can share Vagrant base boxes through Atlas, a service by HashiCorp. So only one has to run Packer and build the Vagrant box and provide it for other team members or the community.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/packer_vagrant_atlas.png" alt="packer atlas vagrant"></p>

<p>Others can create a <code>Vagrantfile</code> with the box name of one of the provided Vagrant boxes. That name will be used at the first <code>vagrant up</code> to download the correct Vagrant box for the hypervisor to be used.</p>

<p>Even Microsoft has its first <a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/Microsoft/boxes/EdgeOnWindows10">Vagrant box at Atlas</a> which can be used with VirtualBox only at the moment. But it is only a matter of time that more Hyper-V based Vagrant boxes will show up in Atlas, also boxes for other hypervisors.</p>

<p>If you don't have a Vagrantfile you even can create a simple one to start a new test environment with two commands and a suitable Vagrant box from Atlas.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant init Microsoft/EdgeOnWindows10  
vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant itself can log into the VM through WinRM and run further provision scripts to setup a good development or test environment. It is just a decision what to install in a Vagrant box with Packer and what to install with Vagrant afterwards. You decide which flexibility you want or if you prefer a faster <code>vagrant up</code> experience with a full provisioned Vagrant box that was built with a longer running Packer build once.</p>

<h2 id="dockerwindowsbox">docker-windows-box</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a test environment for Windows Docker containers you might have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box">docker-windows-box</a> GitHub repo that installs Git and some additional Docker tools to get started working on some <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">Windows Dockerfiles</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/08/docker-windows-box.png" alt="docker windows box"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I'm happy that there is a Hyper-V builder for Packer that really works. Vagrant already has a Hyper-V provider built in so you can have the same experience running and working with VM's as others have with VMware or VirtualBox.</p>

<p>With a such a TP5 Vagrant box it is very easy to get in touch with Windows Docker Containers, regardless if you are working on Windows 10 with Hyper-V or from your Mac or Linux machine with another hypervisor.</p>

This allows you to run Windows Containers directly in Windows 10 as Hyper-V containers. At the moment only NanoServer containers are supported. So it's time to get used to NanoServer and how to create some base images.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/windows10-containers-feature.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this blog post I'll show how to build small base images to deploy Node.js applications as NanoServer Docker images that you can run <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick_start/quick_start_windows_10">in Windows 10</a> or in Windows Server 2016 TP5.</p>

<h2 id="whatisnanoserver">What is Nano Server?</h2>

<p>Each Docker image must use of of the two OS images: <code>windowsservercore</code> or <code>nanoserver</code>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Windows Server Core</strong> image is <strong>highly compatible</strong> with previous Windows Server Core installations. You don't have a GUI, but you can install almost everything into it. But this compatibility comes with a prize, the size of the OS image is about 9.3 GByte as it contains about a whole server.</p>

<p>A <strong>Nano Server</strong> image is <strong>highly optimized</strong> and almost everything was taken out of it to be able to deploy more of these containers in cloud servers. The size is about 817 MByte. This makes installing Docker on Windows 10 much faster than with the <code>windowsservercore</code> OS image.</p>

<p>So if you get asked which to choose you probably would answer to take the smaller one.</p>

<h2 id="thechallengemsipackages">The challenge: MSI packages</h2>

<p>But as soon as you try to write a <code>Dockerfile</code> to install some software into a Docker image you will notice that the minimized OS comes with a new challenge. <strong>You can't install MSI packages in Nano Server.</strong></p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a> there are only MSI packages for Windows if you also want to have npm installed.</p>

<p>So how could we build a Node.js Docker image based on Nano Server? I've tried different ways, eg. also installing tools like lessmsi while building the Nano Server image only to find out that lessmsi is only a 32 bit application. Another restriction in Nano Server: <strong>You only can run 64 bit processes in Nano Server.</strong></p>

<p>Another approach would be installing Node.js on your host machine and copying the files into the Docker image. But I don't want to install more tools than needed on a Docker host.</p>

<p>Therefore I show you a way to use only Docker commands and a Windows Server 2016 TP5 machine to build both Windows Server Core image as well as a Nano Server image with Node.js + npm installed.</p>

<h3 id="step1installmsiintowindowsservercoreimage">Step 1 - Install MSI into Windows Server Core image</h3>

<p>A much easier way is to start with a Windows Server Core image. You can download and install the Node.js MSI package with this <code>Dockerfile</code>. This is very similar to the Linux version and downloads, verifies the download, installs the package and then removes the download again.</p>

<p>Now open an editor with</p>

<pre><code>notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and enter this <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM windowsservercore

ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL info  
ENV NODE_VERSION 4.4.5  
ENV NODE_SHA256 7b2409605c871a40d60c187bd24f6f6ddf10590df060b7d905ef46b3b3aa7f81

RUN powershell -Command \  
    wget -Uri https://nodejs.org/dist/v%NODE_VERSION%/node-v%NODE_VERSION%-x64.msi -OutFile node.msi -UseBasicParsing ; \
    if ((Get-FileHash node.msi -Algorithm sha256).Hash -ne $env:NODE_SHA256) {exit 1} ; \
    Start-Process -FilePath msiexec -ArgumentList /q, /i, node.msi -Wait ; \
    Remove-Item -Path node.msi

CMD [ "node.exe" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>You can build the Node.js Docker image with this command</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t node:4.4.5 .  
</code></pre>

<p>After that you have Node.js + npm installed in this Docker image.</p>

<h3 id="step2distillnodejsfolder">Step 2 - Distill Node.js folder</h3>

<p>Now we want to distill the Node.js folder from the Docker image. To do that we have to run a Docker container and then we can copy the folder to a temporary folder on the host machine.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name=node-temp node:4.4.5 node --version  
docker cp "node-temp:c:\Program Files\nodejs" nodejs  
docker rm -vf node-temp  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="step3copydeploytonanoserverimage">Step 3 - COPY deploy to Nano Server image</h3>

<p>With this extracted folder we build the Nano Server image. The following <code>Dockerfile</code> copies the contents of that temporary folder into the Windows directory which is already in PATH. You may want to put the files in another directory, but then you also have to add it to the <code>PATH</code> environment.</p>

<p>Create a sub folder for the Nano Dockerfile</p>

<pre><code>mkdir nano  
notepad nano\Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and create this <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM nanoserver

COPY nodejs /windows/system32

CMD [ "node.exe" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Run this command to build the Nano Server image</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t node:4.4.5-nano nano  
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have two Docker images, one for Windows Server Core and one for Nano Server.</p>

<p>Here is a small diagram of the three steps we just did:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/nodejs_nanoserver-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I've uploaded both Docker images to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/node-windows/tags/">Docker Hub</a> and found out that the Windows Server Core image is about <strong>55 MByte</strong> and the Nano Server image is only <strong>9 MByte</strong>.</p>

<p>Extracting all the layers of the first Docker image I found out that installing an MSI package also saves a copy of the package in the MSI cache. And running commands also leaves some changes in local databases and the registry which is also stored as difference in the layer.</p>

<p>So one advice to build small Windows Docker images is to avoid installing MSI packages and prefer ZIP files or even using a COPY deployment into an image. Of course MSI packages are often more convenient to install but result in bigger image sizes.</p>

<h2 id="buildappwithonbuild">Build app with ONBUILD</h2>

<p>Another easy way to dockerize your Node.js application is the <code>ONBUILD</code> feature in the <code>Dockerfile</code>. At least for simple examples it is very convenient to use a prepared Docker images with that feature.</p>

<p>So let's build another <code>Dockerfile</code> just like the official <code>node:onbuild</code> image which does these steps to install your application and all the dependencies:</p>

<ol>
<li>copy package.json  </li>
<li>run npm install  </li>
<li>copy rest of sources</li>
</ol>

<p>So we create another folder for that <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code>mkdir nano\onbuild  
notepad nano\onbuild\Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>and the following content:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM node:4.4.5-nano

RUN mkdir \app  
WORKDIR /app

ONBUILD COPY package.json package.json  
ONBUILD RUN npm install  
ONBUILD COPY . .

CMD [ "npm.cmd", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the Nano Server image with the ONBUILD feature:</p>

<pre><code>docker build --isolation=hyperv -t node:4.4.5-nano-onbuild nano/onbuild  
</code></pre>

<p>I have tested this with a small Node.js web server that uses Express and some other dependencies.</p>

<p>To build a dockerized Node.js application running in a Nano Server container you only have to go to your Node.js source code and add a single line <code>Dockerfile</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM nano:4.4.5-nano-onbuild  
</code></pre>

<p>and build your application Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build --isolation=hyperv -t mynodeapp:nano .  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations</h2>

<p>Investigating the layers of such an application showed some other temporary folders which aren't needed inside the Docker image.</p>

<ol>
<li>A npm-cache folder  </li>
<li>Many files in temp folder, also from npm</li>
</ol>

<p>So we can optimize that ONBUILD <code>Dockerfile</code> a little bit to remove these temp folders while building your application Docker image. There is a command <code>npm cache clean</code>, but this didn't work for me, so I have changed that to some <code>rd</code> commands. This is the final ONBUILD <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM node:4.4.5-nano

RUN mkdir \app  
WORKDIR /app

ONBUILD COPY package.json package.json  
ONBUILD RUN npm install &amp; rd /s /q %APPDATA%\npm-cache &amp; for /d %G in ("%TEMP%\npm-*") do rd /s /q "%~G"  
ONBUILD COPY . .

CMD [ "npm.cmd", "start" ]  
</code></pre>

<p>With that optimized Docker image deploying a simple Express web server the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/hello-dresden/tags/">final application Docker image</a> went down from <strong>24 MByte</strong> to <strong>15 MByte</strong>. In comparison with the unoptimized Windows Server Core image the same application is <strong>82 MByte</strong> on the Docker Hub.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you don't want to build these Node.js Docker images manually you can find them on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/stefanscherer/node-windows/">Docker Hub</a> with links to the Dockerfiles in the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/node">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>With such a Node.js Nano Server base image on the Docker Hub you can start developing on your Windows 10 machine. Now dockerize your Node.js apps into Nano Server containers and share them with others via the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>The Windows Server 2016 is only needed to install MSI packages and distill the software into Nano Server images.</p>

The latest Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 is a good starting point to see the current state of the Docker Engine running on Windows and get in touch with Windows Containers.</p>

<p>Very soon there will be a Microsoft Azure template to get started very easily. Another simple way will be creating a Docker Machine in Azure, once a <a href="https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/3329">pull request</a> is merged.</p>

<h2 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h2>

<p>But for now it takes some effort and time to set up such a local VM. There are good tutorials that guide you through all the steps needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/setup-docker-windows-server-2016">Setup Docker on Windows Server 2016 in VirtualBox</a> by Arun Gupta</li>
<li><a href="https://lostechies.com/gabrielschenker/2016/04/30/windows-docker-containers/">Windows Docker Containers in Hyper-V</a> by Gabriel Schenker</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="packervagrantautomation">Packer + Vagrant = Automation</h2>

<p>If you don't want to do all these whole setup manually and wait in front of your computer to enter the next step you can use Packer and Vagrant.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.packer.io">Packer</a> takes the ISO file and bakes a base box VM to be used with <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. With Vagrant you can spin up one ore more such VM's and even form a Windows Docker Swarm.</p>

<p>The Packer template to create a Windows 2016 TP5 VM including the Docker Engine is tested with VirtualBox 5.0.20 and VMware Fusion 8.1 and should also work with VMware Workstation if you are working with a Windows PC.</p>

<h3 id="runpacker">Run Packer</h3>

<p>To build the Vagrant base box with Packer 0.10.0 you just clone the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
</code></pre>

<p>Now build the Vagrant base box for VMware</p>

<pre><code>packer build --only=vmware-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>or for VirtualBox.</p>

<pre><code>packer build --only=virtualbox-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>This takes about an hour, so you can leave your computer for a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/packer-build.png" alt="packer-build"></p>

<p>After that a box file should be created in the current directory. Now add this box to Vagrant with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_2016_tp5_docker windows_2016_docker_vmware.box  
</code></pre>

<p>If you have both hypervisors, you also can create both base boxes and add them. You can list all your base boxes with</p>

<pre><code>$ vagrant box list
windows_2016_tp5_docker (virtualbox, 0)  
windows_2016_tp5_docker (vmware_desktop, 0)  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="runvagrant">Run Vagrant</h2>

<p>Now you can create test and dev scenarios with this new base box. There is <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box">another GitHub</a> repo for that. We just clone it with</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box  
cd docker-windows-box  
</code></pre>

<p>With the current Vagrant 1.8.1 it is easy to spin up a VM to have Docker running on Windows 2016 TP5.</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up  
</code></pre>

<p>Vagrant powers up a VM and install further Docker tools like Machine and Compose. Also Git will be installed to get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/brogersyh/Dockerfiles-for-windows">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-container-samples/windowsservercore">Windows</a> <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows">Dockerfiles</a> available on GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/vagrant-up-1.png" alt="vagrant-up"></p>

<p>You can open a PowerShell window and run for example</p>

<pre><code>docker version  
docker images  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/05/docker-version.png" alt="docker-version"></p>

<p>Congratulations! You can start working with a brand new Docker Engine running on Windows 2016 TP5.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<h2 id="whatpackerdoesforyou">What Packer does for you</h2>

<p>If you want to understand what Packer does building such a VM in an automated way here is a list of provision scripts that Packer runs.</p>

<h3 id="installfeatures">Install features</h3>

<p>In the script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/enable-winrm.ps1">enable-winrm.ps1</a>, just before the WinRM port will be opened to let Packer login and do further provisioning some Windows features like Containers and Hyper-V (only VMware) will be enabled.</p>

<h3 id="installdocker">Install Docker</h3>

<p>The next script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/install-docker.ps1">install-docker.ps1</a> installs the Docker service and client and the <code>windowsservercore</code> base Docker image. If Hyper-V is enabled, also the <code>nanoserver</code> base Docker images will be installed.</p>

<h3 id="patchwindowsservercoreimage">Patch windowsservercore image</h3>

<p>As the TP5 and relating files and images are very fresh and it is still a technical preview, there might be some obstacles here and there.</p>

<p>At the moment <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/e2751260-4494-4b60-999e-5ea27ccbe1db/workaround-to-increase-boot-time-for-windows-server-core-containers?forum=windowscontainers">we need this script</a> to speed up the <code>windowsservercore</code> Docker image a little bit. The script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/patch-boot-time-for-containers.ps1">patch-boot-time-for-containers.ps1</a> just fixes that for you.</p>

<h3 id="enableinsecuredockerport2375">Enable insecure Docker port 2375</h3>

<p>For a local test environment we also just open the insecure Docker port 2375 with the script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/enable-docker-insecure.ps1">enable-docker-insecure.ps1</a>. <br>
You can remote control your Windows Docker engine from your host machine that is running the VM. Try it out, especially if you are normally working with Linux or Mac.</p>

<p>Once there is a Docker Machine driver for local Windows VM's is available I would prefer that and have the secure TLS connection.</p>

<h3 id="adddockergroup">Add docker group</h3>

<p>The new Windows Docker engine listens to a Windows named pipe. This is very similar to the Unix socket on Linux.</p>

<p>A normal user does not have access to it, so you have to open an administrator shell to work with the Docker engine.</p>

<p>The script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/add-docker-group.ps1">add-docker-group.ps1 <br>
</a> adds the option <code>-G docker</code> to the Docker engine to give all members of the Windows group <code>docker</code> access to that named pipe.</p>

<p>The script also adds the user <code>vagrant</code> to that group. So in the final Vagrant box you just open a normal PowerShell window and can use the Docker engine.</p>

<h3 id="removekeyjson">Remove key.json</h3>

<p>The final script <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows/blob/df8dedca5e1421290de322b3dfbb0e08a834f122/scripts/docker/remove-docker-key-json.ps1">remove-docker-key-json.ps1 <br>
</a> removes the <code>key.json</code> file from the initial installation. This file will be created on the first start of the Docker engine in each Vagrant VM and creates different ID's for each Docker engine.</p>

<p>This is important if you want to build a Windows Docker Swarm. Each Docker engine needs a different ID.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>As there might be updates in the Docker base images and the Docker engine itself it is now very easy to reproduce the base VM with Packer and Vagrant without all the manual steps again.</p>

Sure I had to get in touch with that new toy as soon as possible to see what has changed since TP4 that was released in November 2015.</p>

<p>As I haven't found an Azure template (<strong>update:</strong> today I found <a href="https://portal.azure.com/?feature.intlpolyfill=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryFeaturedMenuItemBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home/searchQuery/Windows%20Server%202016%20Technical%20Preview%205">Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5</a>), I prepared my packer templates in <a href="https://github.com/stefanscherer/packer-windows/tree/tp5">a tp5 branch</a> that still need some changes to automatically build and install Docker and the Docker base images.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-27-um-21-18-51.png" alt="packer build"></p>

<p>Even without a 100% solution this was a good first starting point build a first Vagrant box to start with and to do the remaining steps from <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/deployment/deployment?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396">Container Host Deployment - Windows Server</a> manually.</p>

<p>I'm really addicted to the automation workflow</p>

<ol>
<li><code>packer build</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant box add</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant up</code>  </li>
<li><code>vagrant destroy -f</code></li>
</ol>

<p>because you won't do it only once to build and have such a test environment. But setting it up is the hard way.</p>

<p>If you are impatient to wait for a complete packer template you can follow Arun Gupta's steps to build a <a href="http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/april/setup-docker-windows-server-2016">TP5 VM in VirtualBox</a>.</p>

<p>Now let's see what's new in the Technical Preview 5.</p>

<h2 id="wayfasternomoresleep">Way faster - no more sleep</h2>

<p>Building some Docker images with one of the Windows Dockerfiles I tested with TP4 are now <strong>much faster</strong> and as well you do not need to do the workaround of sleeping some seconds in each <code>RUN</code> command. Just remove this and forget about it.</p>

<h2 id="ipadressescanbeinspected">IP adresses can be inspected</h2>

<p>One of the obstacles porting the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-birthday-3/pull/165">Docker Birthday app to TP4 Windows containers</a> was the missing ability to fetch the IP adress of each container.</p>

<p>Running <code>docker inspect</code> now shows the IP address of the container.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-27-um-22-33-29.png" alt="container ip address"></p>

<p>I will have to test whether the links in a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file will work as well to set up a simple multi container app using simple host names.</p>

<p>But that's a good improvement of the networking in Windows containers.</p>

<h2 id="npipeisyourunixsocket">npipe is your unix socket</h2>

<p>Another interesting thing is that the Docker engine now listens to a Windows named pipe, just like a Unix socket on Linux.</p>

<p>This leads to a very unixish behavior that you have to be "sudo" to run docker commands:</p>

<p>Running the docker client without adminstratotion rights you can't connect to it.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-28-um-00-01-29.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is a way to allow specific users to use this named pipe just like on Linux adding users to the docker group, but I haven't found out the group name for this short test.</p>

<h2 id="kitematicmeetswindowsagain">Kitematic meets Windows (again)</h2>

<p>At this evening I also played with Docker for Windows Beta in a parallel VM and installed Kitematic there. As the Beta uses Kitematic without VirtualBox I thought this should also work well with TP5. So I took the ZIP file from the Beta download and tweaked my TP5 installation a little bit to make Kitematic talk to the Window Docker Engine.</p>

<p>My very pragmatic way to make this work was to add the local TCP port 2375 to the Docker Engine by editing the start script</p>

<pre><code>notepad C:\ProgramData\docker\runDockerDaemon.cmd  
</code></pre>

<p>and change the dockerd command to <code>dockerd -H npipe:// -H 127.0.0.1:2375</code> and then run</p>

<pre><code>restart-service docker  
</code></pre>

<p>The downloaded version of Kitematic for the Beta also searches for <code>docker.local</code>, so I added the loopback IP address to the host table with</p>

<pre><code class="language- ">notepad C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/04/Bildschirmfoto-2016-04-28-um-00-23-13.png" alt="kitematic-on-tp5"></p>

<p>Now Kitematic starts up without creating a local VM and shows the local Windows containers on the left side.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to explore in TP5 as you now can <strong>pull and push</strong> Docker Images from and to the Docker Hub.</p>

<p>So stay tuned of upcoming blog posts. With the TP5 the community can follow the progress of Docker on Windows much better and can check the latest improvements and pull requests of the Windows Docker Engine.</p>

That tutorial just used a prebuilt Swarm Docker image that was loaded from local disk.</p>

<p>Some people asked me how I have built that container image. Assuming you have a Windows Server 2016 TP4 machine you nowadays need nothing more than the right Dockerfiles to do this.</p>

<p>So let's start writing a <code>Dockerfile</code> to build Docker Swarm inside a Docker container. For the next steps open a PowerShell window and then open an editor.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">notepad Dockerfile.builder  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="useabaseimage">Use a base image</h3>

<p>Swarm is written in Go, so we look for a useful base image. And there already is one useful base image in the <strong>Docker Hub</strong>. So we begin the Dockerfile with the following line.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">FROM microsoft/golang  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installgit">Install Git</h3>

<p>Additionally to Go we also need Git installed inside the Container image. So we use the following lines that will download and install Git for Windows and then remove the installer again. As a further step we add Git to the <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV GIT_VERSION 2.7.2

RUN powershell -Command \  
    Sleep 2 ; \
    wget https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v%GIT_VERSION%.windows.1/Git-%GIT_VERSION%-64-bit.exe -outfile gitinstaller.exe ; \
    Start-Process .\gitinstaller.exe -ArgumentList '/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /CLOSEAPPLICATIONS /DIR=c:\git' -Wait ; \
    rm .\gitinstaller.exe

RUN setx PATH %PATH%;C:\git\cmd;C:\git\bin;C:\git\usr\bin  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="installandbuildgodepandswarm">Install and build Godep and Swarm</h3>

<p>The Swarm project uses <code>Godep</code> to manage the dependencies. We also need this tool as well as the Swarm sources. So let's install both and run the <code>godep</code> tool to build the <code>swarm.exe</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Dockerfile">ENV SWARM_VERSION v1.1.3  
ENV GOPATH C:/go

WORKDIR /go

RUN powershell -Command \  
    Sleep 2 ; \
    go get github.com/tools/godep ; \
    mkdir src\github.com\docker ; \
    cd src\github.com\docker ; \
    git clone https://github.com/docker/swarm ; \
    cd swarm ; \
    git checkout %SWARM_VERSION% ; \
    Start-Process -FilePath godep.exe -ArgumentList go, install, . -Wait
</code></pre>

<p>Now save the <code>Dockerfile.builder</code> file and close the editor.</p>

<p>Back in the PowerShell build the Docker image with the name <code>swarm-builder</code> and the given Dockerfile with the following command.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">docker build -t swarm-builder -f Dockerfile.builder .  
</code></pre>

<p>This now creates a Docker image with multiple layers, for each <code>ENV</code> and <code>RUN</code> command in the <code>Dockerfile</code>. You can see the actions on your screen and finally the command finishes and you can list your images with</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p>You should see a image with the name <code>swarm-builder</code>:</p>

<pre><code>REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE  
swarm-builder       latest              04e557dd075a        31 minutes ago      1.219 GB  
</code></pre>

<p>The size of the Docker image is not good for deployment as we have all the development tools and source codes inside it.</p>

<h3 id="testandextracttheswarmexe">Test and extract the swarm.exe</h3>

<p>We only need the <code>swarm.exe</code> from this image as it is a static binary. So we just run the Docker image and have a very little test of the binary just created by showing its version.</p>

<p>After that we copy the <code>swarm.exe</code> from the container back to the host.</p>

<pre><code>docker run --name swarm-builder swarm-builder swarm --version  
docker cp swarm-builder:/go/bin/swarm.exe ./swarm.exe  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="buildasmallswarmimage">Build a small Swarm image</h3>

<p>The final Docker image for deployment can be produced with a much simpler <code>Dockerfile</code>. As the time of writing the Technical Preview 4 needs a small workaround to access the network inside a container. We have to add a small helper script for now.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">nodepad run.ps1  
</code></pre>

<p>The small PowerShell script just sleeps a little and then calls <code>swarm.exe</code> with the arguments given.</p>

<pre><code>Sleep 2  
\swarm.exe $args
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is time to write the <code>Dockerfile</code>. So open an editor with the following command. Notice the dot '.' as this helps Notepad create a <code>Dockerfile</code> without an extension.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmd">notepad Dockerfile.  
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> now uses the <code>windowsservercore</code> base image and copies the helper script and the swarm binary into the image and sets the entrypoint.</p>

<pre><code>FROM windowsservercore

COPY ./swarm.exe /swarm.exe  
COPY ./run.ps1 /run.ps1

ENV SWARM_HOST :2375

ENTRYPOINT ["powershell.exe", "-File", "/run.ps1"]  
CMD ["--help"]  
</code></pre>

<p>We now build the final Docker image with</p>

<pre><code>docker build -t swarm .  
</code></pre>

<p>Just check the size of the Docker images again with</p>

<pre><code>docker images  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-images.png" alt="docker images"></p>

<p>If you build a new version of the Swarm image later it is useful to tag each Docker image with its version. For this tutorial we have built Swarm 1.1.3, so we tag it with</p>

<pre><code>docker tag swarm:latest swarm:1.1.3  
</code></pre>

<p>You now can run a Swarm container eg. with</p>

<pre><code>docker run -it swarm:1.1.3 --version  
</code></pre>

<p>and you will see the version of the <code>swarm.exe</code>.</p>

<h3 id="automateallthethings">Automate all the things</h3>

<p>Both the Dockerfiles and a build script can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/tree/master/swarm">dockerfiles-windows</a> GitHub repo. Even to download the sources you do not need more than a PowerShell window. Just download it as a ZIP and extract it:</p>

<pre><code>wget -outfile src.zip https://github.com/StefanScherer/dockerfiles-windows/archive/master.zip  
Expand-Archive .\dockerfiles-windows.zip  
</code></pre>

<p>The steps to build both the development Docker image as well the final image is added to a small build script which can be run with this commands</p>

<pre><code>cd src\dockerfiles-windows-master\swarm  
.\build.bat
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tldr">TL/DR</h3>

<p>Even on Windows you now can put development environments into Docker images and build small images for deployment with a two step approach. No special setup is needed on your host machine, just Docker should be reachable.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is reproducable</strong> on every team members machines. And a CI build pipeline can take advantage of this dockerized setup as well.</p>

<p>I hope you get a feeling what you can do with your own software project and <strong>start dockerizing</strong> as well.</p>

In this blog post I explain how to set up a Windows Docker Swarm. I use this setup for demonstration purposes, so the VM's are running locally on my laptop.</p>

<p>At the time of writing there is no docker-machine driver to create the Windows Docker VM's. And my laptop at work is still running with Windows 7, so I have chosen VirtualBox as a local hypervisor instead of Hyper-V.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/windows_swarm_demo.png" alt="Network diagram"></p>

<p>As you can see in the diagram there also is a private Docker registry. I just want to show you that saving and restoring Windows Docker images is just as easy as on Linux.</p>

<p>A laptop with 16GB memory is capable of running this setup. With less memory, just run only two of the Windows VM's and reduce the memory setting.</p>

<h2 id="setupyourhost">Setup your host</h2>

<p>If you like to follow this tutorial you need some tools on your host machine. Pleas keep in mind that VirtualBox does not work with Hyper-V on the same machine. My preferred way to setup a Windows machine is by install the software with <a href="https://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey</a>. So these are the steps needed for the host tools:</p>

<pre><code>iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))  
choco install -y virtualbox  
choco install -y vagrant  
choco install -y packer  
choco install -y docker  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="buildthevagrantbox">Build the Vagrant box</h2>

<p>Before spinning up the swarm you have to build the Windows Server 2016 VM with Docker installed. As I'm a big fan of automation I do not click through the installers, but use <a href="https://packer.io">Packer</a> and <a href="https://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to build and run local VM's.</p>

<p>Before running Packer you should register to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-technical-preview">technical preview evaluation</a> and accept the license for the Windows Server ISO file.</p>

<p>After that just clone my Packer templates and build the VirtualBox VM with</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows  
cd packer-windows  
packer build --only=virtualbox-iso windows_2016_docker.json  
</code></pre>

<p>Now add the Vagrant box to the local list of baseboxes with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant box add windows_2016_docker windows_2016_docker_virtualbox.box  
</code></pre>

<h2 id="buildthedockerswarm">Build the Docker swarm</h2>

<p>The next step is also very easy. We clone <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box/tree/master/swarm-demo">the repo</a> with the Vagrantfile for the Docker swarm and spin up all boxes.</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker-windows-box  
cd docker-windows-box  
cd swarm-demo  
vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
</code></pre>

<p>One after another the VM's are booted and provisioned with the shell scripts provided in the <code>scripts</code> folder.</p>

<h4 id="registry">registry</h4>

<p>The Linux box <code>registry</code> is used for the Docker Swarm manager and a Docker registry.</p>

<ol>
<li>The swarm manager is using a token in <code>config/swarm-token</code>. Edit this as you like.  </li>
<li>The registry is using the <code>registry-v2</code> folder on your host to store the Docker images.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="swwin01">sw-win-01 ...</h4>

<p>The Windows Server 2016 TP4 machines that spin up a Swarm container to join the Docker Swarm. The Docker Engines have a connection to the insecure registry running at <code>registry:5000</code>.</p>

<h2 id="upandrunning">Up and running</h2>

<p>After a while all VM's are up and running and you can see the status with <code>vagrant status</code></p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/vagrant-status.png" alt="vagrant status"></p>

<p>The Docker Swarm is built and all Windows VM's have joined the swarm. You can check this by connecting with the Docker Client to the Swarm Manager.</p>

<pre><code>docker -H tcp://192.168.38.100:3375 info  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-info.png" alt="docker info"></p>

<h2 id="runcontainersintheswarm">Run containers in the swarm</h2>

<p>For a very simple demo we now run three containers that are spread over all three Windows Docker Swarm agents.</p>

<pre><code>docker -H tcp://192.168.38.100:3375 run -d windowsservercore powershell -Command sleep 60  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/03/docker-run.png" alt="docker run"></p>

<p>As you can see the containers are running on all different Docker nodes <code>sw-win-01</code> ... <code>sw-win-03</code>.</p>

<p>With the local registry you can push and pull Windows images from it and safe your work. The registry files are stored at your host so it is safe to destroy all VM's if you do not use them.</p>

<p>I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial. In a future blog post I probably show how to build a Windows Docker Swarm in Azure or in Hyper-V.</p>

But does Docker run on 32bit Intel CPU's as well?</p>

<h2 id="whytheheck">Why the heck?</h2>

<p>Weeks ago when I wrote some integration tests for <code>docker-machine</code> to test the Chocolatey package on AppVeyor CI and I thought: Wouldn't it be cool to create eg. a real VirtualBox Docker Machine on a CI server and have some real tests there? But I soon found out that most/all of the CI servers out in the cloud also are virtualized. And none really supports what's called <strong>nested hypervisor</strong> - to run a 64bit VM in a 64bit VM. I left the integration tests with some tests with the driver <code>none</code> and forgot about the idea.</p>

<p>Last week I sat before my old PC running 32bit Windows and I thought if it is possible to run Docker on it as well. I normally use <code>docker-machine</code> to spin up Docker from Windows in a Linux boot2docker VM. And with Chocolatey I can install the 32bit Windows version of <code>docker-machine</code>. But spinning up a VirtualBox Docker Machine doesn't work on my PC as it can't run 64bit VM's. So the idea came back into my mind.</p>

<p>So what is missing to create such a 32bit VM to have at least a running Docker Engine?</p>

<ul>
<li>a 32bit Docker Engine binary for x86 CPU</li>
<li>a 32bit boot2docker.iso file that is used by <code>docker-machine</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So I first searched for some issues on GitHub what others said about 32bit Docker.</p>

<p>I found this interesting Issue <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/136">docker/docker#136</a> with a comment by Solomon Hykes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here's what I suggest:</p>
  
  <p>Step 1: docker only supports amd64. It will refuse to start a container on any other architecture.This should be made clear to the user.</p>
  
  <p>Step 2: docker will eventually support more architectures, including i386. This will include arch-specific images, facilities to look them up etc.</p>
  
  <p>So, I will accept anything that makes it easier to support multiple architectures <em>in the future</em>. But for now we're sticking to amd64.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That last sentence made me smile. Hey, aren't we doing multi architecture right now? Is the future now?</p>

<p>I started a proof of concept, but didn't want to waste disk space and computing power locally. So I also tested if such a task could be done right from your web browser. Just fork the <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">docker/docker</a> repo and start patching the <code>Dockerfile</code> to build it for 32bit. Then fork the <a href="https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker">boot2docker/boot2docker</a> repo as well and do the same thing here. To build the DEB package and the ISO file I used TravisCI and deployed the output as a GitHub release to the forked repo.</p>

<p>So my build pipeline looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker_build_pipeline-png-shadow.png" alt="boot2docker build pipeline"></p>

<p>I created two pull requests against the forked repos to have the TravisCI build status for each commit. And also we can diff the modified files very easily in the browser.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/docker/pull/1">docker/pull/1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/pull/1">boot2docker/pull/1</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On the afternoon my kids wanted to play some computer games, so I had to leave my MacBook and PC. But no problem with this setup, I just continued on my iPad.</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-ipad.jpg" alt="committing from iPad"></p>

<p>Porting the <code>Dockerfile</code> from amd64 to another CPU you first have to solve the <code>FROM ubuntu:trusty</code> line and find a base image. Crazy enough there already are some 32bit Docker Image, so I just could use <code>FROM 32bit/ubuntu:14.04</code> instead.</p>

<p>And step by step I ported packages, filenames, directory names to fit the i386 architecture. <br>
For the boot2docker the problem was to compile a 32bit kernel first, but a <code>make menuconfig</code> is your friend to change all the kernel switches needed to turn off 64bit.</p>

<h2 id="willitwork">Will it work?</h2>

<p>And after the ISO file was finished I tried it with an <code>appveyor.yml</code> to build a integration test for the Chocolatey package on a Windows CI server. There are some technical details to solve right now to install VirtualBox inside the build server without network issues.</p>

<p>So I tested it manually in an AppVeyor CI server through a RDP session. I installed VirtualBox with Chocolatey and then downloaded the 32bit boot2docker.iso file from the GitHub release and started up a boot2docker VM right in AppVeyor:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-in-appveyor.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<p>And does it run containers? Yes, pulling the <code>32bit/ubuntu:14.04</code> Docker image and running it also works inside the AppVeyor CI server:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-run-container.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<p><strong>Update 2016/02/27</strong>: Setting a specific NIC type works for AppVeyor and finally proofs that <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/StefanScherer/boot2docker/build/44">starting a Docker Machine VM in AppVeyor works</a>. See the <a href="https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/blob/x86/appveyor.yml">appveyor.yml</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="tryityourself">Try it yourself</h2>

<p>You can try the 32bit version of Docker yourself on your laptop by creating a VM with <code>docker-machine</code> and adjusting some defaults:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.10.1-386/boot2docker.iso dev32  
</code></pre>

<p>There is a preview of version 1.9.1 and 1.10.1. Here is the output of <code>docker version</code> running from my Mac against the 32bit Linux Docker Engine running in VirtualBox:</p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/boot2docker-version-1.png" alt="boot2docker in appveyor"></p>

<h2 id="nestedvm">"Nested" VM?</h2>

<p>We can do another crazy thing with it. VirtualBox is not able to run nested 64bit VM's. But with this 32bit boot2docker it is possible to run the boot2docker VM inside a VirtualBox VM: </p>

<p><img src="https://stefanscherer.github.io/content/images/2016/02/container_in_virtualbox_in_virtualbox_on_mac-2.png" alt="nested-virtualbox"></p>

<p>I used this <code>Vagrantfile</code> to create the 64bit VirtualBox VM</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|  
  config.vm.box = "boxcutter/ubuntu1404"
  config.vm.network "public_network"
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
     vb.memory = "2048"
  end
end  
</code></pre>

<p>Now spin up the VM and log into it with</p>

<pre><code>vagrant up --provider virtualbox  
vagrant ssh  
</code></pre>

<p>Now inside the 64bit VM you install the Docker client, VirtualBox and Docker Machine with a patch to really disable VT-X checks. Future versions of Docker Machine will allow you to do that as pull request <a href="https://github.com/docker/machine/pull/3018">#3018</a> got merged recently.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update  
curl https://get.docker.com | sudo sh  
sudo apt-get install -y virtualbox  
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.9.1-386/docker-machine-Linux-x86_64  
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine  
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is time again to create the 32bit Docker Machine VM with</p>

<pre><code>docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-no-vtx-check --virtualbox-boot2docker-url https://github.com/StefanScherer/boot2docker/releases/download/v1.10.1-386/boot2docker.iso dev  
eval $(docker-machine env dev)  
docker version  
docker-machine ls  
docker run -it 32bit/ubuntu:14.04 bash  
</code></pre>

<p>This proof of concept shows that running Docker in a 32bit VM really could work. And it enables you to experiment a little more. But keep in mind that this is not officially supported and extremely experimental.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this little tour. As always I love to get feedback. What is your use case to run Docker on 32bit? Please leave a comment below or share it on Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
